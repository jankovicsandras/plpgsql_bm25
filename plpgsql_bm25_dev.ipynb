        "\n",
        "----\n",
        "### News\n",
        " - Proof of concept works.\n",
        " - PL/pgSQL BM25 search functions work in Postgres without any extensions / Rust\n",
        " - BM25 index builder works in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "### Roadmap / TODO\n",
        " - PL/pgSQL index builder (or other languages e.g. JavaScript)\n",
        " - ```bm25topk()``` should use dynamic column names, not the fixed ```id```, ```full_description```\n",
        " - implement other algorithms from rank_bm25, not just Okapi\n",

        "### Usage in a nutshell\n",
        "Python index building:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# build BM25 index\n",
        "mybm25_index = mybm25okapi(tokenized_corpus)\n",
        "# export wsmap to CSV\n",
        "mybm25_index.exportwsmap( csvfilepath )\n",
        "# import wsmap to Postgres from CSV\n",
        "msq('SELECT bm25importwsmap(\\''+tablename_bm25wsmap+'\\',\\''+csvfilepath+'\\');')\n",
        "```\n",
        "Postgres search:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "msq('SELECT bm25topk.id, bm25topk.score, bm25topk.doc FROM bm25topk(\\''+tablename+'\\', \\''+tablename_bm25wsmap+'\\',\\''+json.dumps(tokenizedquestion).replace(\"'\",\"\\'\\'\")+'\\', 10);')\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "----\n",
        "### What is this?\n",
        " - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25\n",
        " - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/pgSQL\n",
        " - https://github.com/dorianbrown/rank_bm25\n",
        " - TLDR:\n",
        "    - BM25Okapi is a popular search algorithm.\n",
        "    - Index building: Initially, there's a list of texts or documents called the corpus. Each document will be split to words (or tokens) with the tokenization function (the simplest is split on whitespace characters). The algorithm then builds a word-score-map ```wsmap```, where every word in the corpus is scored for every document based on their frequencies, ca. how special a word is in the corpus and how frequent in the current document.\n",
        "    - Search: the question text (or query string) will be tokenized, then the search function looks up the words from ```wsmap``` and sums the scores for each document; the result is a list of scores, one for each document. The highest scoring document is the best match. The search function sorts the scores-documentIDs in descending order.\n",
        "    - The ```wsmap``` is stored in a simple dict in Python ``` { 'word1': [doc1score, doc2score, ... ], 'word2':[doc1score, doc2score, ... ], ... }``` and a simple table in Postgres ```|word TEXT|vl JSON|``` where ```vl == [doc1score, doc2score, ... ]```.\n",
        "    - Adding a new document to the corpus or changing one requires rebuilding the whole BM25 index (```wsmap```), because of how the algorithm works.\n",
        "\n",
        "----\n",
        "### Repo contents\n",
        " - ```plpgsql_bm25_dev.ipynb``` : Jupyter notebook where I develop this.\n",
        " - ```mybm25okapi.py``` : Python BM25 index builder, see also https://github.com/dorianbrown/rank_bm25\n",
        " - ```plpgsql_bm25.sql``` : PL/pgSQL functions for search\n",
        "\n",
        "----\n",
        "### Why?\n",
        "Postgres has already Full Text Search and there are several extensions that implement BM25. But Full Text Search is not the same as BM25. The BM25 extensions are written in Rust, which might not be available / practical, especially in hosted environments. See Alternatives section for more info.\n",
        "\n",
        "----\n",
        "### Alternatives:\n",

        " - Postgres Full Text Search\n",
        "   - https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch.html\n",
        "   - https://postgresml.org/blog/postgres-full-text-search-is-awesome\n",

        " - Postgres similarity of text using trigram matching\n",
        "   - https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgtrgm.html\n",
        "\n",
        "   - NOTE: this is useful for fuzzy string matching, like spelling correction, but not query->document search solution itself.\n",
        "The differing document and query text lengths will result very small relative trigram frequencies and incorrect/missing matching.\n",

So I need to show the revision date by any user of each published page. Possibly complicating things is I have post/page revisions disabled in wp- config.php to keep the database down to size, so an action can't hook into already existing page revision metadata.

            "964 I have a WooCommerce site and a specific distributor who will be redirecting products from a taxable region (Germany) to a non-taxable region (Russia). Thanks to various forms, this makes them exclusive of VAT. Through the VAT settings on WooCommerce, I setup an extra rule for the specific postal code with zero tax - unfortunately the result is a line of zero tax, and a line of standard VAT, rather than the desired line of zero tax only. I then tried to setup the standard tax rule in Germany to exclude the single postal code, using 1-xxxxx and xxxxx-99999 where xxxxx is the number below and above the postal code respectively. THis results in a huge tax rule that WooCommerce clearly doesn't like, as it switches off any form of tax for any region at any time. Does anyone have any suggestions as to how I could override the taxation for just this address and force it to zero? I am happy to make a hook to do this, but wouldn't know where to start.

            "|mybm25okapi| 11 4.138795 I have a WooCommerce site and a specific distributor who will be redirecting products from a taxable region (Germany) to a non-taxable region (Russia). Thanks to various forms, this makes them exclusive of VAT. Through the VAT settings on WooCommerce, I setup an extra rule for the specific postal code with zero tax - unfortunately the result is a line of zero tax, and a line of standard VAT, rather than the desired line of zero tax only. I then tried to setup the standard tax rule in Germany to exclude the single postal code, using 1-xxxxx and xxxxx-99999 where xxxxx is the number below and above the postal code respectively. THis results in a huge tax rule that WooCommerce clearly doesn't like, as it switches off any form of tax for any region at any time. Does anyone have any suggestions as to how I could override the taxation for just this address and force it to zero? I am happy to make a hook to do this, but wouldn't know where to start.

I then tried to setup the standard tax rule in Germany to exclude the single postal code, using 1-xxxxx and xxxxx-99999 where xxxxx is the number below and above the postal code respectively. THis results in a huge tax rule that WooCommerce clearly doesn't like, as it switches off any form of tax for any region at any time.

Thanks to various forms, this makes them exclusive of VAT. Through the VAT settings on WooCommerce, I setup an extra rule for the specific postal code with zero tax - unfortunately the result is a line of zero tax, and a line of standard VAT, rather than the desired line of zero tax only. I then tried to setup the standard tax rule in Germany to exclude the single postal code, using 1-xxxxx and xxxxx-99999 where xxxxx is the number below and above the postal code respectively. THis results in a huge tax rule that WooCommerce clearly doesn't like, as it switches off any form of tax for any region at any time. Does anyone have any suggestions as to how I could override the taxation for just this address and force it to zero? I am happy to make a hook to do this, but wouldn't know where to start.

Through the VAT settings on WooCommerce, I setup an extra rule for the specific postal code with zero tax - unfortunately the result is a line of zero tax, and a line of standard VAT, rather than the desired line of zero tax only. I then tried to setup the standard tax rule in Germany to exclude the single postal code, using 1-xxxxx and xxxxx-99999 where xxxxx is the number below and above the postal code respectively. THis results in a huge tax rule that WooCommerce clearly doesn't like, as it switches off any form of tax for any region at any time.

I then tried to setup the standard tax rule in Germany to exclude the single postal code, using 1-xxxxx and xxxxx-99999 where xxxxx is the number below and above the postal code respectively. THis results in a huge tax rule that WooCommerce clearly doesn't like, as it switches off any form of tax for any region at any time.

THis results in a huge tax rule that WooCommerce clearly doesn't like, as it switches off any form of tax for any region at any time.

Through the VAT settings on WooCommerce, I setup an extra rule for the specific postal code with zero tax - unfortunately the result is a line of zero tax, and a line of standard VAT, rather than the desired line of zero tax only. I then tried to setup the standard tax rule in Germany to exclude the single postal code, using 1-xxxxx and xxxxx-99999 where xxxxx is the number below and above the postal code respectively. THis results in a huge tax rule that WooCommerce clearly doesn't like, as it switches off any form of tax for any region at any time. Does anyone have any suggestions as to how I could override the taxation for just this address and force it to zero? I am happy to make a hook to do this, but wouldn't know where to start.

'/buttons.js',        array('jquery'),        '1.0' );           wp_enqueue_script('buttons');      }      ?>       In the outputted Source Code, the script seems to have properly loaded.               <script type='text/javascript' src='http://localhost:8888/italina/wp-includes/js/jquery/jquery.js?ver=1.8.3'></script>     <script type='text/javascript' src='http://localhost:8888/italina/wp-content/themes/italina-responsive-child/buttons.js?ver=1.0'></script>      But the button has no effect. For good measure, here's the HTML it should be affecting:               <button id=\"openbtn\">Opening Times</button>             <div id=\"openingtimes\" class=\"headboxes\">                     <p>                        Mondays: Closed<br />                        Tues-Fri: Noon-3pm; 5.30pm-10pm<br />                        Sat-Sun: Noon-10.30pm<br />                     </p>             </div>      Any help much appreciated.\n",

I don't know if I could use a conditional to check the current users role and if it is anything other than admin then use the remove_shortcode() function?
