            "14 |About a month ago I started a WordPress blog on a hosted server related to a hobby. So, I am new to this at present. Since I'm concerned about security, one thing I did was to install the plugin WP Security Scan. According to the plugin results, my site checks out except that I get this in the results as a red flag: > The file .htaccess does not exist in wp-admin/ (I ssh'd in there and it does > not exist) Ok, so I did a considerable search on the issue and find too much info on .htaccess. I've been through Hardening WordPress on the WordPress.org site, etc. And also ran into this article: http://digwp.com/2010/07/wordpress- security-lockdown/ Anyway, I've basically gotten confused with the plethora of information available. **What should the .htaccess file in wp-admin contain?** I've read that this .htaccess file should password protect the wp-admin directory and I've also read that this can cause functionality problems. Help with this is greatly appreciated. Thanks. -wdypdx22 **Update** Ok, so I'm not logged in to my blog and using a different computer than usual. I enter the url www.mysite.com/wordpress/wp-admin/ and there is a redirect to login. If that's what happens, then is an htaccess file even needed in the wp-admin directory? |\n",

I tried to change it to something like this:               <?php if ( have_comments() ) : ?>             <?php if ( ! empty($comments_by_type['comment']) ) : ?>            <h2 class=\"h2comments\"><img src=\"http://zoomingjapan.com/wp-content/themes/alltuts-child/images/comments_big.png\" /><?php comments_number('No Comments', '1 Comment', '% Comments' );?> <a href=\"#respond\" class=\"addComment\"><img src=\"http://zoomingjapan.com/wp-content/themes/alltuts/images/add_your_coment_ver2.png\" border=\"0\"></a></h2>                       <ul class=\"commentlist\">           <?php wp_list_comments('type=comment&callback=mytheme_comment'); ?>             </ul>             <?php endif; ?>                  <?php if ( ! empty($comments_by_type['pings']) ) : ?>             <h2 id=\"pings\">Trackbacks/Pingbacks</h2>                  <ul class=\"commentlist\">             <?php wp_list_comments('type=pings'); ?>             </ul>             <?php endif; ?>                <div class=\"navigation\">       <?php paginate_comments_links(); ?>       </div>      <?php else : // this is displayed if there are no comments so far ?>                  <?php if ('open' == $post->comment_status) : ?>                     <!-- If comments are open, but there are no comments. -->                  <?php else : // comments are closed ?>                     <!-- If comments are closed. -->                     <p class=\"nocomments\">Comments are closed.</p>                  <?php endif; ?>     <?php endif; ?>      However, now neither pingbacks, nor comments show up unless I take out the \"if empty\" command. If I do, then the pingback headline shows up again even if there are no pingbacks. This is driving me crazy! Maybe it has to do with the callback function?

To fix this, I want Jetpack to use the old-style permalinks for stories dated prior to the change. Unfortunately, it looks like I'll have to filter the content of `get_permalink` to do it. So I have my function to return the fixed permalinks:               function jetpack_sharing_permalink( $permalink, $post, $leavename ) {              $url_change_date = strtotime( \"23 February 2013\" ); // Date of the URL changeover         $post_date = get_the_time( 'U', $post->ID );              if ( $post_date < $url_change_date ) :             $url_date_prefix = \"/\" . date( \"Y\", $post_date ) . \"/\" . date( \"m\", $post_date );             $permalink = str_replace( get_site_url(), get_site_url() . $url_date_prefix, $permalink );         endif;              return $permalink;          }        1.

I want to configure Akamai to exclude any important URLs that should never be cached (i.e., don't want to serve cached login/admin pages). Is there a compilation, or general recommendation, of all important URLs that should never be cached? Here's what I've got so far:   * `/wp-*` (This would prevent wp-includes/admins/etc)   * `/xmlrpc.php`   * Any URL with with `?preview=true` so that editors can preview **Edit: Additional info below** We are using Akamai edge cache, which is **full site caching**. Basically, Akamai acts as a reverse proxy server. Our DNS is pointing at Akamai, visitors hit Akamai directly. Akamai only hits us to update pages when TTL expires, or when a page is requested that isn't already cached. We have the ability to exclude parts of the site from being fully cached, for example URLs matching `wp-*`, or any urls with the query string `preview=true`. Exclusions do allow cookies to be passed through; POST requests are also allowed. With this additional info, the original question still remains -- what WP- specific URLs/paths/etc need to be excluded from the **full-site caching** to prevent things from breaking? E.g., previews obviously need to be dynamic by nature, so I've excluded that by allowing `preview=true` query string. What else do I need to exclude? Is anything matching `wp-*` good enough, or are other things missing, i.e. `/xmlrpc.php`? I hope things brings some additional context to the original question. |\n",

            "69 |11.996410641548264 |**Scenario:** there is a 'Recommended Books' section on the website which uses the _'book' custom post type_ and the _'author' custom taxonomy_. I'm using Amazon Product Advertising API for retrieving book data and covers. When adding a new 'book' into WordPress, the user copies the book ID (ASIN) into the post edit field, and clicks 'Publish'. Then, when saving the post, the post title (book title) and the author taxonomy term should be programmatically filled in through Amazon. (These are used to offer 'Order by' functionality on the front end.) Currently I'm using `wp_insert_post_data` to hook into the 'book' saving process, and the `wp_set_object_terms` function to try to add the custom taxonomy term to the 'book'. **The problem is:** the `wp_set_object_terms` function doesn't seem to work. It won't add anything, albeit returns an array which, according to Codex, should mean success. Though the returning array is odd (as far as I see). When using post ID 107 and term ID 3 (instead of an author string, for testing purposes) the returning array displays the following with `print_r`:               Array     (     [0] => 3     )      (Also tried with `wp_set_post_terms`, and it makes no difference.)

            "67 |**Scenario:** there is a 'Recommended Books' section on the website which uses the _'book' custom post type_ and the _'author' custom taxonomy_. I'm using Amazon Product Advertising API for retrieving book data and covers. When adding a new 'book' into WordPress, the user copies the book ID (ASIN) into the post edit field, and clicks 'Publish'. Then, when saving the post, the post title (book title) and the author taxonomy term should be programmatically filled in through Amazon. (These are used to offer 'Order by' functionality on the front end.) Currently I'm using `wp_insert_post_data` to hook into the 'book' saving process, and the `wp_set_object_terms` function to try to add the custom taxonomy term to the 'book'. **The problem is:** the `wp_set_object_terms` function doesn't seem to work. It won't add anything, albeit returns an array which, according to Codex, should mean success. Though the returning array is odd (as far as I see). When using post ID 107 and term ID 3 (instead of an author string, for testing purposes) the returning array displays the following with `print_r`:               Array     (     [0] => 3     )      (Also tried with `wp_set_post_terms`, and it makes no difference.)

            "67 | 11.996410641548303 | **Scenario:** there is a 'Recommended Books' section on the website which uses the _'book' custom post type_ and the _'author' custom taxonomy_. I'm using Amazon Product Advertising API for retrieving book data and covers. When adding a new 'book' into WordPress, the user copies the book ID (ASIN) into the post edit field, and clicks 'Publish'. Then, when saving the post, the post title (book title) and the author taxonomy term should be programmatically filled in through Amazon. (These are used to offer 'Order by' functionality on the front end.) Currently I'm using `wp_insert_post_data` to hook into the 'book' saving process, and the `wp_set_object_terms` function to try to add the custom taxonomy term to the 'book'. **The problem is:** the `wp_set_object_terms` function doesn't seem to work. It won't add anything, albeit returns an array which, according to Codex, should mean success. Though the returning array is odd (as far as I see). When using post ID 107 and term ID 3 (instead of an author string, for testing purposes) the returning array displays the following with `print_r`:               Array     (     [0] => 3     )      (Also tried with `wp_set_post_terms`, and it makes no difference.) My complete function:               // Function to automatically retrieve and store Amazon Book data (title and author) when adding 'book' type posts     if( function_exists('asa_item') ) {         add_filter( 'wp_insert_post_data', 'filter_handler', '99', 2 );         function filter_handler( $data , $postarr ) {                  // Proceed only if book is added/edited             if ( $postarr['post_type'] !== 'book')                 return $data;                  // Try to Extract ASIN from post body; ignore everything else             if ( preg_match( '/([0-9A-Z]{10})/', $data['post_content'],  $matches) ) {                 // Successful, store ASIN                 $book_asin = $matches[0];                 // Wrap ASIN in AmazonSimpleAdmin shortcode (with 'cover' template) automatically for user convenience                 $data['post_content'] = '[asa cover]' . $matches[0] .

Note: The posts are all in the same category.

            "66 | 5.916578441202358 | I have an issue that I believe can be solved one of two ways. I am using Featured Images in posts for content on a home page slider. What I would like to have happen is to have the destination links on click to be custom. Not the post or image URL of the post/featured image being used to feed the slider. 1) I thought I might be able to use the Image URL feature on the image itself, but it turns out the Featured Images will not accept a custom URL. It defaults back to the image path. 2) I have tried using a custom Post Meta field, but my attempts to retrieve that meta have been unsuccessful. I have set a Meta Field with the name \"slider-url\" and have dropped the path to the desired destination page into the field. I am then using the following code in the loop for the slider (from the WP Codex) in an attempt to pull that value into the href=\"\" `<?php echo get_post_meta($post->ID, \"slider-url\", true); ?>` I am hoping someone might either have a hack for the Featured Image \"Image URL\" (along with a way to retrieve that URL), or alternately some insight into why my custom post meta might not be working. Thanks in advance for your time and expertise. Cheers! EDIT: Here's the specific block of code. It's contained within the PHP file of the slider plugin.                   <div id=\"slider\">     <?php          $category = get_option('wpns_category');         $n_slices = get_option('wpns_slices');     ?>     <?php query_posts( 'cat='.$category.'&posts_per_page=$n_slices' ); if( have_posts() ) : while( have_posts() ) : the_post(); ?>         <?php if(has_post_thumbnail()) : ?>         <a href=\"<?php echo get_post_meta($post->ID, \"slider-url\", true); ?>\" title=\"<?php the_title(); ?>\">              <?php the_post_thumbnail(); ?>         </a>         <?php endif ?>         <?php endwhile; endif;?>         <?php wp_reset_query();?>     </div>      Additionally, here's a screen capture of the post meta field: http://s.sct.io/Bl6O Thanks again!\n",

            "67 |**Scenario:** there is a 'Recommended Books' section on the website which uses the _'book' custom post type_ and the _'author' custom taxonomy_. I'm using Amazon Product Advertising API for retrieving book data and covers. When adding a new 'book' into WordPress, the user copies the book ID (ASIN) into the post edit field, and clicks 'Publish'. Then, when saving the post, the post title (book title) and the author taxonomy term should be programmatically filled in through Amazon. (These are used to offer 'Order by' functionality on the front end.) Currently I'm using `wp_insert_post_data` to hook into the 'book' saving process, and the `wp_set_object_terms` function to try to add the custom taxonomy term to the 'book'. **The problem is:** the `wp_set_object_terms` function doesn't seem to work. It won't add anything, albeit returns an array which, according to Codex, should mean success. Though the returning array is odd (as far as I see). When using post ID 107 and term ID 3 (instead of an author string, for testing purposes) the returning array displays the following with `print_r`:               Array     (     [0] => 3     )      (Also tried with `wp_set_post_terms`, and it makes no difference.)

            "66 |I have an issue that I believe can be solved one of two ways. I am using Featured Images in posts for content on a home page slider. What I would like to have happen is to have the destination links on click to be custom. Not the post or image URL of the post/featured image being used to feed the slider. 1) I thought I might be able to use the Image URL feature on the image itself, but it turns out the Featured Images will not accept a custom URL. It defaults back to the image path. 2) I have tried using a custom Post Meta field, but my attempts to retrieve that meta have been unsuccessful. I have set a Meta Field with the name 'slider-url' and have dropped the path to the desired destination page into the field. I am then using the following code in the loop for the slider (from the WP Codex) in an attempt to pull that value into the href='' `<?php echo get_post_meta($post->ID, 'slider-url', true); ?>` I am hoping someone might either have a hack for the Featured Image 'Image URL' (along with a way to retrieve that URL), or alternately some insight into why my custom post meta might not be working. Thanks in advance for your time and expertise. Cheers! EDIT: Here's the specific block of code.

On my FTP I found the following files in /wordpress/wp-content/uploads/ > 012 KB 0666 29.04.2013 14:56 Jellyfish-150x112.jpg   >  015 KB 0666 29.04.2013 14:56 Jellyfish-150x150.jpg   >  026 KB 0666 29.04.2013 14:56 Jellyfish-300x225.jpg   >  082 KB 0666 29.04.2013 14:11 Jellyfish-787x300.jpg   >  009 KB 0666 29.04.2013 14:56 Jellyfish-90x67.jpg   >  017 KB 0666 29.04.2013 14:23 Jellyfish-e1367238219134-150x150.jpg   >  016 KB 0666 29.04.2013 14:58 Jellyfish-e1367240287874-150x150.jpg   >  758 KB 0666 29.04.2013 13:34 Jellyfish.jpg I searched in the template and the plugin but it seems like they simple just use the_post_thumbnail and output the Jellyfish-150x150.jpg image (which is the useless autogenerated thumbnail). Am I doing something wrong? What is the Jellyfish-e1367238219134-150x150.jpg image for? How can I choose which part of the image I want to show as a thumbnail?\n",

            "15 |( I would ask this in the general stack exchange forum but I think it is more relevant here. I'm intentionally using direct queries to the database here. ) I'm trying to select a group of users that have two distinct meta key and meta value parameters. For example, select all usernames and ID for users with both where a meta_key= 'key1' and meta_value='value1' and also for the same user where another meta_key = 'keyA' and meta_value = 'valueA' In otherwords, I have multiple sets of metadata for a user, I'm looking for a specific set of users that meet criteria in two groups of metadata. There is no relation between the two metadata entries, except that they are both applied to the same user. The challenge that I am having is that I guess I'm trying to left join any metadata entry to the respective user without having to do a double query. Is it possible? Here's what I've tried:               SELECT wp_users.ID, wp_users.display_name     FROM wp_users LEFT JOIN wp_usermeta ON wp_users.ID = wp_usermeta.user_id AND       wp_usermeta.meta_value= 'value1'     WHERE  wp_usermeta.meta_key = 'keyA' AND wp_usermeta.meta_value = 'valueA'       I've also tried this:               SELECT wp_users.ID, wp_users.display_name     FROM wp_users LEFT JOIN wp_usermeta ON wp_users.ID = wp_usermeta.user_id        WHERE (wp_usermeta.meta_key = 'key1' AND wp_usermeta.meta_value= 'value1')     AND ( wp_usermeta.meta_key = 'keyA' AND wp_usermeta.meta_value = 'valueA')       Both these return empty sets. I suspect that it is only left joining to one usermeta entry and so when I'm telling it to look for the second set of values in the usermeta entry that has been left joined to the user entry that it returns an empty set. My question is how do I filter through all the user meta info so that I can only return users with results that match both. Thanks for looking! -------- UPDATE -------------- This is the final code that worked for me:               SELECT u.ID, u.display_name     FROM wp_users AS u      LEFT JOIN wp_usermeta AS um1 ON u.ID = um1.user_id      LEFT JOIN wp_usermeta AS um2 ON u.ID = um2.user_id      WHERE  um1.meta_key = 'key1' AND um1.meta_value = 'value1'      AND um2.meta_key = 'keyA' AND um2.meta_value = 'valueA'     LIMIT 0, 60 |\n",

            "27 |I have a site with a custom post. When I enter that custom post in admin (edit)-page then a form is rendered. This form takes like about 2-3s to render - it's a lot of of values in it - both hidden and not hidden. When I update this custom post it takes about 2 seconds to update - and after the update it redirects to the custom post and renders the form again, so overall it could take about 8-9 seconds (regeneration of menu, some other stuff that is loaded each time in the wp-admin area). My question is: Is there any way just to save post data when upate - like hooking ajax-call to UPDATE-button (I really don't have to reload the page cause it doesn't change anything)? **UPDATE:** I guess I could something like this (in jQuery)               $( '#publish' ).click( function( e ) {         e.preventDefault();         //ajax call to save current postetc.         //done = alert('post saved');     } );      but would that be right? |\n",

            "45 |4.802403823725191 |I am using the german Wordpress 3.5.1–de_DE with Woocommerce 2.0.8 and the Woothemes Mystile Theme 1.2.8. I have a big picture for a product (Jellyfish.jpg) and want to use a specific area of that big picture as a thumbnail, because Wordpress/Woocommerce automatically chooses a not useful part of the image. So I used the Wordpress crop tool in Edit Image under Media to generate a 150x150 thumbnail. This sucessfully generates a thumbnail (like Jellyfish-e1367238219134-150x150.jpg) but WP/Woocommerce uses another image (Jellyfish-150x150.jpg).

            "68 |4.368653355267325 |I have an issue that I believe can be solved one of two ways. I am using Featured Images in posts for content on a home page slider. What I would like to have happen is to have the destination links on click to be custom. Not the post or image URL of the post/featured image being used to feed the slider. 1) I thought I might be able to use the Image URL feature on the image itself, but it turns out the Featured Images will not accept a custom URL. It defaults back to the image path. 2) I have tried using a custom Post Meta field, but my attempts to retrieve that meta have been unsuccessful. I have set a Meta Field with the name 'slider-url' and have dropped the path to the desired destination page into the field. I am then using the following code in the loop for the slider (from the WP Codex) in an attempt to pull that value into the href='' `<?php echo get_post_meta($post->ID, 'slider-url', true); ?>` I am hoping someone might either have a hack for the Featured Image 'Image URL' (along with a way to retrieve that URL), or alternately some insight into why my custom post meta might not be working.

So I used the Wordpress crop tool in Edit Image under Media to generate a 150x150 thumbnail.

            "66 | 4.368653355267325 | I have an issue that I believe can be solved one of two ways. I am using Featured Images in posts for content on a home page slider. What I would like to have happen is to have the destination links on click to be custom. Not the post or image URL of the post/featured image being used to feed the slider. 1) I thought I might be able to use the Image URL feature on the image itself, but it turns out the Featured Images will not accept a custom URL. It defaults back to the image path. 2) I have tried using a custom Post Meta field, but my attempts to retrieve that meta have been unsuccessful. I have set a Meta Field with the name \"slider-url\" and have dropped the path to the desired destination page into the field. I am then using the following code in the loop for the slider (from the WP Codex) in an attempt to pull that value into the href=\"\" `<?php echo get_post_meta($post->ID, \"slider-url\", true); ?>` I am hoping someone might either have a hack for the Featured Image \"Image URL\" (along with a way to retrieve that URL), or alternately some insight into why my custom post meta might not be working.

            "14 |About a month ago I started a WordPress blog on a hosted server related to a hobby. So, I am new to this at present. Since I'm concerned about security, one thing I did was to install the plugin WP Security Scan. According to the plugin results, my site checks out except that I get this in the results as a red flag: > The file .htaccess does not exist in wp-admin/ (I ssh'd in there and it does > not exist) Ok, so I did a considerable search on the issue and find too much info on .htaccess. I've been through Hardening WordPress on the WordPress.org site, etc. And also ran into this article: http://digwp.com/2010/07/wordpress- security-lockdown/ Anyway, I've basically gotten confused with the plethora of information available. **What should the .htaccess file in wp-admin contain?** I've read that this .htaccess file should password protect the wp-admin directory and I've also read that this can cause functionality problems. Help with this is greatly appreciated. Thanks. -wdypdx22 **Update** Ok, so I'm not logged in to my blog and using a different computer than usual. I enter the url www.mysite.com/wordpress/wp-admin/ and there is a redirect to login. If that's what happens, then is an htaccess file even needed in the wp-admin directory? |\n",

Not the post or image URL of the post/featured image being used to feed the slider. 1) I thought I might be able to use the Image URL feature on the image itself, but it turns out the Featured Images will not accept a custom URL.

            "69 |9.297809928475257 |**Scenario:** there is a 'Recommended Books' section on the website which uses the _'book' custom post type_ and the _'author' custom taxonomy_. I'm using Amazon Product Advertising API for retrieving book data and covers. When adding a new 'book' into WordPress, the user copies the book ID (ASIN) into the post edit field, and clicks 'Publish'. Then, when saving the post, the post title (book title) and the author taxonomy term should be programmatically filled in through Amazon. (These are used to offer 'Order by' functionality on the front end.) Currently I'm using `wp_insert_post_data` to hook into the 'book' saving process, and the `wp_set_object_terms` function to try to add the custom taxonomy term to the 'book'. **The problem is:** the `wp_set_object_terms` function doesn't seem to work. It won't add anything, albeit returns an array which, according to Codex, should mean success. Though the returning array is odd (as far as I see). When using post ID 107 and term ID 3 (instead of an author string, for testing purposes) the returning array displays the following with `print_r`:               Array     (     [0] => 3     )      (Also tried with `wp_set_post_terms`, and it makes no difference.)

Note: The posts are all in the same category. I can define the list of posts in the category in the order defined by the custom field value but when I view the single post, with a template modified to show only the selected category, the nav links at the bottom of the page are based on chronological sequence.

            "30 | 10.426776536478716 | I've started writing a plugin that allows the administrator to select specific pages and set them to be visible **only to logged-in users** ; the plugin optionally applies the restriction to **all child pages** too. When a site visitor attempts to view any of these pages, they get redirected to the login page. So far, so good. It all works to that point, and duplicates functionality I've seen in existing plugins. However, what I also want to do is to **automatically remove all of those pages (including child pages, where specified) from the front-end site's menus**. I don't want them visible at all unless you're logged in. I've seen solutions where people create two menus and switch between them depending on logged-in status, but that's an extra step I'd rather not have.

            "30 |I've started writing a plugin that allows the administrator to select specific pages and set them to be visible **only to logged-in users** ; the plugin optionally applies the restriction to **all child pages** too. When a site visitor attempts to view any of these pages, they get redirected to the login page. So far, so good. It all works to that point, and duplicates functionality I've seen in existing plugins. However, what I also want to do is to **automatically remove all of those pages (including child pages, where specified) from the front-end site's menus**. I don't want them visible at all unless you're logged in. I've seen solutions where people create two menus and switch between them depending on logged-in status, but that's an extra step I'd rather not have. I thought I could perhaps approach this by adding a filter or action hook for 'wp_nav_menu_items' in the plugin code, but I've had no success with that yet. Any thoughts? Thanks Phil * * * Additional details (smaller chunk of the problem): Here's some code from my plugin that I'm trying to use to hook into the menu items:               add_filter('wp_nav_menu_items','ppa_filter_visible_menus');          function ppa_filter_visible_menus($nav) {         die('filter menus');     }      The problem I have is that ppa_filter_visible_menus is not called. |\n",

            "69 |3.8566844808618526 |**Scenario:** there is a 'Recommended Books' section on the website which uses the _'book' custom post type_ and the _'author' custom taxonomy_. I'm using Amazon Product Advertising API for retrieving book data and covers. When adding a new 'book' into WordPress, the user copies the book ID (ASIN) into the post edit field, and clicks 'Publish'. Then, when saving the post, the post title (book title) and the author taxonomy term should be programmatically filled in through Amazon. (These are used to offer 'Order by' functionality on the front end.) Currently I'm using `wp_insert_post_data` to hook into the 'book' saving process, and the `wp_set_object_terms` function to try to add the custom taxonomy term to the 'book'. **The problem is:** the `wp_set_object_terms` function doesn't seem to work. It won't add anything, albeit returns an array which, according to Codex, should mean success. Though the returning array is odd (as far as I see). When using post ID 107 and term ID 3 (instead of an author string, for testing purposes) the returning array displays the following with `print_r`:               Array     (     [0] => 3     )      (Also tried with `wp_set_post_terms`, and it makes no difference.)

            "67 | 3.8566844808618526 | **Scenario:** there is a 'Recommended Books' section on the website which uses the _'book' custom post type_ and the _'author' custom taxonomy_. I'm using Amazon Product Advertising API for retrieving book data and covers. When adding a new 'book' into WordPress, the user copies the book ID (ASIN) into the post edit field, and clicks 'Publish'. Then, when saving the post, the post title (book title) and the author taxonomy term should be programmatically filled in through Amazon. (These are used to offer 'Order by' functionality on the front end.) Currently I'm using `wp_insert_post_data` to hook into the 'book' saving process, and the `wp_set_object_terms` function to try to add the custom taxonomy term to the 'book'. **The problem is:** the `wp_set_object_terms` function doesn't seem to work. It won't add anything, albeit returns an array which, according to Codex, should mean success. Though the returning array is odd (as far as I see). When using post ID 107 and term ID 3 (instead of an author string, for testing purposes) the returning array displays the following with `print_r`:               Array     (     [0] => 3     )      (Also tried with `wp_set_post_terms`, and it makes no difference.)

Thanks\n",
            "67 | 3.8566844808618526 | **Scenario:** there is a 'Recommended Books' section on the website which uses the _'book' custom post type_ and the _'author' custom taxonomy_. I'm using Amazon Product Advertising API for retrieving book data and covers. When adding a new 'book' into WordPress, the user copies the book ID (ASIN) into the post edit field, and clicks 'Publish'. Then, when saving the post, the post title (book title) and the author taxonomy term should be programmatically filled in through Amazon. (These are used to offer 'Order by' functionality on the front end.) Currently I'm using `wp_insert_post_data` to hook into the 'book' saving process, and the `wp_set_object_terms` function to try to add the custom taxonomy term to the 'book'. **The problem is:** the `wp_set_object_terms` function doesn't seem to work. It won't add anything, albeit returns an array which, according to Codex, should mean success. Though the returning array is odd (as far as I see). When using post ID 107 and term ID 3 (instead of an author string, for testing purposes) the returning array displays the following with `print_r`:               Array     (     [0] => 3     )      (Also tried with `wp_set_post_terms`, and it makes no difference.) My complete function:               // Function to automatically retrieve and store Amazon Book data (title and author) when adding 'book' type posts     if( function_exists('asa_item') ) {         add_filter( 'wp_insert_post_data', 'filter_handler', '99', 2 );         function filter_handler( $data , $postarr ) {                  // Proceed only if book is added/edited             if ( $postarr['post_type'] !== 'book')                 return $data;                  // Try to Extract ASIN from post body; ignore everything else             if ( preg_match( '/([0-9A-Z]{10})/', $data['post_content'],  $matches) ) {                 // Successful, store ASIN                 $book_asin = $matches[0];                 // Wrap ASIN in AmazonSimpleAdmin shortcode (with 'cover' template) automatically for user convenience                 $data['post_content'] = '[asa cover]' . $matches[0] .

Here's what I've tried:               SELECT wp_users.ID, wp_users.display_name     FROM wp_users LEFT JOIN wp_usermeta ON wp_users.ID = wp_usermeta.user_id AND       wp_usermeta.meta_value= 'value1'     WHERE  wp_usermeta.meta_key = 'keyA' AND wp_usermeta.meta_value = 'valueA'       I've also tried this:               SELECT wp_users.ID, wp_users.display_name     FROM wp_users LEFT JOIN wp_usermeta ON wp_users.ID = wp_usermeta.user_id        WHERE (wp_usermeta.meta_key = 'key1' AND wp_usermeta.meta_value= 'value1')     AND ( wp_usermeta.meta_key = 'keyA' AND wp_usermeta.meta_value = 'valueA')       Both these return empty sets. I suspect that it is only left joining to one usermeta entry and so when I'm telling it to look for the second set of values in the usermeta entry that has been left joined to the user entry that it returns an empty set. My question is how do I filter through all the user meta info so that I can only return users with results that match both.

            "14 | 12.899523643083358 | About a month ago I started a WordPress blog on a hosted server related to a hobby. So, I am new to this at present. Since I'm concerned about security, one thing I did was to install the plugin WP Security Scan. According to the plugin results, my site checks out except that I get this in the results as a red flag: > The file .htaccess does not exist in wp-admin/ (I ssh'd in there and it does > not exist) Ok, so I did a considerable search on the issue and find too much info on .htaccess. I've been through Hardening WordPress on the WordPress.org site, etc. And also ran into this article: http://digwp.com/2010/07/wordpress- security-lockdown/ Anyway, I've basically gotten confused with the plethora of information available. **What should the .htaccess file in wp-admin contain?** I've read that this .htaccess file should password protect the wp-admin directory and I've also read that this can cause functionality problems. Help with this is greatly appreciated. Thanks. -wdypdx22 **Update** Ok, so I'm not logged in to my blog and using a different computer than usual. I enter the url www.mysite.com/wordpress/wp-admin/ and there is a redirect to login. If that's what happens, then is an htaccess file even needed in the wp-admin directory?\n",

            "62 | 2.0736812670249223 | We know, using `wp_head()` and `wp_footer()` all the scripts and styles are enqueued using `wp_enqueue_styles` and `wp_enqueue_scripts` hook. What we do is to enqueue our stylesheets and scripts using `functions.php`. And similarly WordPress plugins also enqueue their stylesheets and scripts using the same method. So, in the end there are many enqueued styles and scripts in header or footer. What Google PageSpeed recommends is: > **Optimize the order of styles and scripts** \\- Google PageSpeed We know, `wp_enqueue_script()` and `wp_enqueue_style()` offer a `$deps` parameter, where we can define the depth or priority of the script or stylesheet. But that affects only within scripts and styles, not in both. So, with a combined load of scripts and stylesheets from the theme, and/or child theme, and/or plugins, and/or third party API etc. how can we let the WordPress to enqueue them all in a way so that site speed improves with a sound website's quality?   Or, are they bulletproof to echo styles first, than scripts?\n",

Here's how I created my CPT:               function my_custom_post_participant() {         $labels = array(             'name'               => _x( 'Participants', 'post type general name' ),             'singular_name'      => _x( 'Participant', 'post type singular name' ),             'add_new'            => _x( 'Add New', 'participant' ),             'add_new_item'       => __( 'Add New Participant' ),             'edit_item'          => __( 'Edit Participant' ),             'new_item'           => __( 'New Participant' ),             'all_items'          => __( 'All Participants' ),             'view_item'          => __( 'View Participant' ),             'search_items'       => __( 'Search Participants' ),             'not_found'          => __( 'No participants found' ),             'not_found_in_trash' => __( 'No participants found in the Trash' ),              'parent_item_colon'  => '',             'menu_name'          => 'Participants'         );         $args = array(             'labels'        => $labels,             'description'   => 'Holds our participants and participant specific data',             'public'        => true,             'menu_position' => 4,             'supports'      => array( 'title', 'custom-fields' ),             'has_archive'   => true,         );         register_post_type( 'participant', $args );      }     add_action( 'init', 'my_custom_post_participant' );          function my_updated_messages_participant( $messages ) {         global $post, $post_ID;         $messages['participant'] = array(             0 => '',              1 => sprintf( __('Participant updated. <a href=\"%s\">View participant</a>'), esc_url( get_permalink($post_ID) ) ),             2 => __('Custom field updated.'),             3 => __('Custom field deleted.'),             4 => __('Participant updated.'),             5 => isset($_GET['revision']) ? sprintf( __('Participant restored to revision from %s'), wp_post_revision_title( (int) $_GET['revision'], false ) ) : false,             6 => sprintf( __('Participant published. <a href=\"%s\">View participant</a>'), esc_url( get_permalink($post_ID) ) ),             7 => __('Participant saved.'),             8 => sprintf( __('Participant submitted. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"%s\">Preview participant</a>'), esc_url( add_query_arg( 'preview', 'true', get_permalink($post_ID) ) ) ),             9 => sprintf( __('Participant scheduled for: <strong>%1$s</strong>. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"%2$s\">Preview participant</a>'), date_i18n( __( 'M j, Y @ G:i' ), strtotime( $post->post_date ) ), esc_url( get_permalink($post_ID) ) ),             10 => sprintf( __('Participant draft updated. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"%s\">Preview participant</a>'), esc_url( add_query_arg( 'preview', 'true', get_permalink($post_ID) ) ) ),         );         return $messages;     }     add_filter( 'post_updated_messages', 'my_updated_messages_participant' );      Please note that I altered search function using this code in functions.php:               add_filter( 'pre_get_posts', 'tgm_cpt_search' );     function tgm_cpt_search( $query ) {         if ( $query->is_search )         $query->set( 'post_type', array( 'page') );         return $query;     };\n",

I currently have an 'add to basket' button within the flash application that doesn't do anything. I'd like it to add a product to the basket when clicked. Writing a flash function with event clicks is no problem, but I'm not sure how to connect to the shopping basket and would appreciate any advice on how to do this. It _appears_ to be done in AJAX but I'm not confident in this. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you Dean EDIT AFTER MILO'S COMMENTS: Thanks Milo. Once I understand how to invoke the existing \"function wpsc_add_to_cart()\" I'll try to make it more efficient and implement what you have suggested, but at the moment I'm struggling to invoke the existing one from within flash. I've determined the JQuery I need to call from within Flash is the one below, but I don't know how to call it (it doesn't appear to have a function name like I'm used to seeing):               // Submit the product form using AJAX     jQuery(\"form.product_form\").live('submit', function() {         // we cannot submit a file through AJAX, so this needs to return true to submit the form normally if a file formfield is present         file_upload_elements = jQuery.makeArray(jQuery('input[type=file]', jQuery(this)));         if(file_upload_elements.length > 0) {             return true;         } else {             form_values = jQuery(this).serialize();             // Sometimes jQuery returns an object instead of null, using length tells us how many elements are in the object, which is more reliable than comparing the object to null             if(jQuery('#fancy_notification').length == 0) {                 jQuery('div.wpsc_loading_animation',this).css('visibility', 'visible');             }             jQuery.post( 'index.php?ajax=true', form_values, function(returned_data) {                 eval(returned_data);                 jQuery('div.wpsc_loading_animation').css('visibility', 'hidden');                      if(jQuery('#fancy_notification') != null) {                     jQuery('#loading_animation').css(\"display\", 'none');                 //jQuery('#fancy_notificationimage').css(\"display\", 'none');                 }                  });             wpsc_fancy_notification(this);             return false;         }     });      Any ideas how to call this JQuery from within Flash?

            "94 | 10.220161537266891 | Can I mess up my Wordpress site if I change `functions.php` file for my custom theme? One time I added some code to it and it gave me some PHP errors and my site was inaccessible. Luckily it was in the early stage of the website so I just reinstalled Wordpress. So, my actual question is - does `functions.php` file have any influence on any other file or database or any other part of the website? If I have a back up of the `functions.php` file, can I just replace the screwed up file via FTP or do I have to do something else? The same questions goes for `.htaccess` file - if I add this code:               php_flag register_globals off      to it, can I change something irreversibly or do I just upload the back up and all goes back to normal?\n",

Since I'm concerned about security, one thing I did was to install the plugin WP Security Scan. According to the plugin results, my site checks out except that I get this in the results as a red flag: > The file .htaccess does not exist in wp-admin/ (I ssh'd in there and it does > not exist) Ok, so I did a considerable search on the issue and find too much info on .htaccess. I've been through Hardening WordPress on the WordPress.org site, etc. And also ran into this article: http://digwp.com/2010/07/wordpress- security-lockdown/ Anyway, I've basically gotten confused with the plethora of information available. **What should the .htaccess file in wp-admin contain?** I've read that this .htaccess file should password protect the wp-admin directory and I've also read that this can cause functionality problems. Help with this is greatly appreciated. Thanks. -wdypdx22 **Update** Ok, so I'm not logged in to my blog and using a different computer than usual. I enter the url www.mysite.com/wordpress/wp-admin/ and there is a redirect to login. If that's what happens, then is an htaccess file even needed in the wp-admin directory?\n",

            "56 | 9.583202062002538 | I'm looking for a method to order posts by a custom field so that the navigational links on a single post template would point to the next or previous post in the sequence defined by a number in a custom field. Note: The posts are all in the same category. I can define the list of posts in the category in the order defined by the custom field value but when I view the single post, with a template modified to show only the selected category, the nav links at the bottom of the page are based on chronological sequence. What I need is a way to link to the next/previous post in the same category, where the order is defined by the custom field value. Is there anyway to override the chronological ordering of the posts? Thanks.\n",

Since I'm concerned about security, one thing I did was to install the plugin WP Security Scan. According to the plugin results, my site checks out except that I get this in the results as a red flag: > The file .htaccess does not exist in wp-admin/ (I ssh'd in there and it does > not exist) Ok, so I did a considerable search on the issue and find too much info on .htaccess. I've been through Hardening WordPress on the WordPress.org site, etc. And also ran into this article: http://digwp.com/2010/07/wordpress- security-lockdown/ Anyway, I've basically gotten confused with the plethora of information available. **What should the .htaccess file in wp-admin contain?** I've read that this .htaccess file should password protect the wp-admin directory and I've also read that this can cause functionality problems. Help with this is greatly appreciated. Thanks. -wdypdx22 **Update** Ok, so I'm not logged in to my blog and using a different computer than usual. I enter the url www.mysite.com/wordpress/wp-admin/ and there is a redirect to login. If that's what happens, then is an htaccess file even needed in the wp-admin directory?\n",

            "66 |I have an issue that I believe can be solved one of two ways. I am using Featured Images in posts for content on a home page slider. What I would like to have happen is to have the destination links on click to be custom. Not the post or image URL of the post/featured image being used to feed the slider. 1) I thought I might be able to use the Image URL feature on the image itself, but it turns out the Featured Images will not accept a custom URL. It defaults back to the image path. 2) I have tried using a custom Post Meta field, but my attempts to retrieve that meta have been unsuccessful. I have set a Meta Field with the name 'slider-url' and have dropped the path to the desired destination page into the field. I am then using the following code in the loop for the slider (from the WP Codex) in an attempt to pull that value into the href='' `<?php echo get_post_meta($post->ID, 'slider-url', true); ?>` I am hoping someone might either have a hack for the Featured Image 'Image URL' (along with a way to retrieve that URL), or alternately some insight into why my custom post meta might not be working. Thanks in advance for your time and expertise. Cheers! EDIT: Here's the specific block of code.

            "94 | 15.379033798829848 | Can I mess up my Wordpress site if I change `functions.php` file for my custom theme? One time I added some code to it and it gave me some PHP errors and my site was inaccessible. Luckily it was in the early stage of the website so I just reinstalled Wordpress. So, my actual question is - does `functions.php` file have any influence on any other file or database or any other part of the website? If I have a back up of the `functions.php` file, can I just replace the screwed up file via FTP or do I have to do something else? The same questions goes for `.htaccess` file - if I add this code:               php_flag register_globals off      to it, can I change something irreversibly or do I just upload the back up and all goes back to normal?\n",
            "27 | 15.25233920991276 | I have a site with a custom post. When I enter that custom post in admin (edit)-page then a form is rendered. This form takes like about 2-3s to render - it's a lot of of values in it - both hidden and not hidden. When I update this custom post it takes about 2 seconds to update - and after the update it redirects to the custom post and renders the form again, so overall it could take about 8-9 seconds (regeneration of menu, some other stuff that is loaded each time in the wp-admin area). My question is: Is there any way just to save post data when upate - like hooking ajax-call to UPDATE-button (I really don't have to reload the page cause it doesn't change anything)? **UPDATE:** I guess I could something like this (in jQuery)               $( '#publish' ).click( function( e ) {         e.preventDefault();         //ajax call to save current postetc.         //done = alert('post saved');     } );      but would that be right?\n",

Rather than use multiple user accounts to assign articles, they created a taxonomy for the custom author name(s) so that an archive of posts by an author can be generated. The code is below, and it's working well. However, I'd also like to replace the author name in the feed. I assume it's going to be an extra filter and/or function.

            "66 | 7.798863130186121 | I have an issue that I believe can be solved one of two ways. I am using Featured Images in posts for content on a home page slider. What I would like to have happen is to have the destination links on click to be custom. Not the post or image URL of the post/featured image being used to feed the slider. 1) I thought I might be able to use the Image URL feature on the image itself, but it turns out the Featured Images will not accept a custom URL. It defaults back to the image path. 2) I have tried using a custom Post Meta field, but my attempts to retrieve that meta have been unsuccessful. I have set a Meta Field with the name \"slider-url\" and have dropped the path to the desired destination page into the field. I am then using the following code in the loop for the slider (from the WP Codex) in an attempt to pull that value into the href=\"\" `<?php echo get_post_meta($post->ID, \"slider-url\", true); ?>` I am hoping someone might either have a hack for the Featured Image \"Image URL\" (along with a way to retrieve that URL), or alternately some insight into why my custom post meta might not be working. Thanks in advance for your time and expertise. Cheers! EDIT: Here's the specific block of code. It's contained within the PHP file of the slider plugin.                   <div id=\"slider\">     <?php          $category = get_option('wpns_category');         $n_slices = get_option('wpns_slices');     ?>     <?php query_posts( 'cat='.$category.'&posts_per_page=$n_slices' ); if( have_posts() ) : while( have_posts() ) : the_post(); ?>         <?php if(has_post_thumbnail()) : ?>         <a href=\"<?php echo get_post_meta($post->ID, \"slider-url\", true); ?>\" title=\"<?php the_title(); ?>\">              <?php the_post_thumbnail(); ?>         </a>         <?php endif ?>         <?php endwhile; endif;?>         <?php wp_reset_query();?>     </div>      Additionally, here's a screen capture of the post meta field: http://s.sct.io/Bl6O Thanks again!\n",

            "69 |6.319616696824822 |**Scenario:** there is a 'Recommended Books' section on the website which uses the _'book' custom post type_ and the _'author' custom taxonomy_. I'm using Amazon Product Advertising API for retrieving book data and covers. When adding a new 'book' into WordPress, the user copies the book ID (ASIN) into the post edit field, and clicks 'Publish'. Then, when saving the post, the post title (book title) and the author taxonomy term should be programmatically filled in through Amazon. (These are used to offer 'Order by' functionality on the front end.) Currently I'm using `wp_insert_post_data` to hook into the 'book' saving process, and the `wp_set_object_terms` function to try to add the custom taxonomy term to the 'book'. **The problem is:** the `wp_set_object_terms` function doesn't seem to work. It won't add anything, albeit returns an array which, according to Codex, should mean success. Though the returning array is odd (as far as I see). When using post ID 107 and term ID 3 (instead of an author string, for testing purposes) the returning array displays the following with `print_r`:               Array     (     [0] => 3     )      (Also tried with `wp_set_post_terms`, and it makes no difference.)

I have set a Meta Field with the name 'slider-url' and have dropped the path to the desired destination page into the field. I am then using the following code in the loop for the slider (from the WP Codex) in an attempt to pull that value into the href='' `<?php echo get_post_meta($post->ID, 'slider-url', true); ?>` I am hoping someone might either have a hack for the Featured Image 'Image URL' (along with a way to retrieve that URL), or alternately some insight into why my custom post meta might not be working. Thanks in advance for your time and expertise. Cheers! EDIT: Here's the specific block of code. It's contained within the PHP file of the slider plugin.                   <div id='slider'>     <?php          $category = get_option('wpns_category');         $n_slices = get_option('wpns_slices');     ?>     <?php query_posts( 'cat='.$category.'&posts_per_page=$n_slices' ); if( have_posts() ) : while( have_posts() ) : the_post(); ?>         <?php if(has_post_thumbnail()) : ?>         <a href='<?php echo get_post_meta($post->ID, 'slider-url', true); ?>' title='<?php the_title(); ?>'>              <?php the_post_thumbnail(); ?>         </a>         <?php endif ?>         <?php endwhile; endif;?>         <?php wp_reset_query();?>     </div>      Additionally, here's a screen capture of the post meta field: http://s.sct.io/Bl6O Thanks again! |\n",

            "66 |I have an issue that I believe can be solved one of two ways. I am using Featured Images in posts for content on a home page slider. What I would like to have happen is to have the destination links on click to be custom. Not the post or image URL of the post/featured image being used to feed the slider. 1) I thought I might be able to use the Image URL feature on the image itself, but it turns out the Featured Images will not accept a custom URL. It defaults back to the image path. 2) I have tried using a custom Post Meta field, but my attempts to retrieve that meta have been unsuccessful. I have set a Meta Field with the name 'slider-url' and have dropped the path to the desired destination page into the field. I am then using the following code in the loop for the slider (from the WP Codex) in an attempt to pull that value into the href='' `<?php echo get_post_meta($post->ID, 'slider-url', true); ?>` I am hoping someone might either have a hack for the Featured Image 'Image URL' (along with a way to retrieve that URL), or alternately some insight into why my custom post meta might not be working. Thanks in advance for your time and expertise. Cheers! EDIT: Here's the specific block of code. It's contained within the PHP file of the slider plugin.                   <div id='slider'>     <?php          $category = get_option('wpns_category');         $n_slices = get_option('wpns_slices');     ?>     <?php query_posts( 'cat='.$category.'&posts_per_page=$n_slices' ); if( have_posts() ) : while( have_posts() ) : the_post(); ?>         <?php if(has_post_thumbnail()) : ?>         <a href='<?php echo get_post_meta($post->ID, 'slider-url', true); ?>' title='<?php the_title(); ?>'>              <?php the_post_thumbnail(); ?>         </a>         <?php endif ?>         <?php endwhile; endif;?>         <?php wp_reset_query();?>     </div>      Additionally, here's a screen capture of the post meta field: http://s.sct.io/Bl6O Thanks again! |\n",

            "55 | 5.654448212711252 | I recently changed my permalink structure from `/YYYY/MM/%post_name%/` to `/%post_name%/`, and lost my tweet counts and likes (provided by Jetpack) in the process. To fix this, I want Jetpack to use the old-style permalinks for stories dated prior to the change. Unfortunately, it looks like I'll have to filter the content of `get_permalink` to do it. So I have my function to return the fixed permalinks:               function jetpack_sharing_permalink( $permalink, $post, $leavename ) {              $url_change_date = strtotime( \"23 February 2013\" ); // Date of the URL changeover         $post_date = get_the_time( 'U', $post->ID );              if ( $post_date < $url_change_date ) :             $url_date_prefix = \"/\" . date( \"Y\", $post_date ) . \"/\" . date( \"m\", $post_date );             $permalink = str_replace( get_site_url(), get_site_url() . $url_date_prefix, $permalink );         endif;              return $permalink;          }        1. How do I use it to filter the output of `get_permalink`? Is my theme's `functions.php` too late?   2. How would I get started writing a 'baby' plugin (as suggested) so that `get_permalink` is only filtered for Jetpack's Sharing feature? Thanks in advance.\n",

I want to configure Akamai to exclude any important URLs that should never be cached (i.e., don't want to serve cached login/admin pages). Is there a compilation, or general recommendation, of all important URLs that should never be cached?

Basically, Akamai acts as a reverse proxy server. Our DNS is pointing at Akamai, visitors hit Akamai directly. Akamai only hits us to update pages when TTL expires, or when a page is requested that isn't already cached. We have the ability to exclude parts of the site from being fully cached, for example URLs matching `wp-*`, or any urls with the query string `preview=true`. Exclusions do allow cookies to be passed through; POST requests are also allowed. With this additional info, the original question still remains -- what WP- specific URLs/paths/etc need to be excluded from the **full-site caching** to prevent things from breaking?

I'm intentionally using direct queries to the database here. ) I'm trying to select a group of users that have two distinct meta key and meta value parameters. For example, select all usernames and ID for users with both where a meta_key= 'key1' and meta_value='value1' and also for the same user where another meta_key = 'keyA' and meta_value = 'valueA' In otherwords, I have multiple sets of metadata for a user, I'm looking for a specific set of users that meet criteria in two groups of metadata. There is no relation between the two metadata entries, except that they are both applied to the same user. The challenge that I am having is that I guess I'm trying to left join any metadata entry to the respective user without having to do a double query. Is it possible? Here's what I've tried:               SELECT wp_users.ID, wp_users.display_name     FROM wp_users LEFT JOIN wp_usermeta ON wp_users.ID = wp_usermeta.user_id AND       wp_usermeta.meta_value= 'value1'     WHERE  wp_usermeta.meta_key = 'keyA' AND wp_usermeta.meta_value = 'valueA'       I've also tried this:               SELECT wp_users.ID, wp_users.display_name     FROM wp_users LEFT JOIN wp_usermeta ON wp_users.ID = wp_usermeta.user_id        WHERE (wp_usermeta.meta_key = 'key1' AND wp_usermeta.meta_value= 'value1')     AND ( wp_usermeta.meta_key = 'keyA' AND wp_usermeta.meta_value = 'valueA')       Both these return empty sets. I suspect that it is only left joining to one usermeta entry and so when I'm telling it to look for the second set of values in the usermeta entry that has been left joined to the user entry that it returns an empty set. My question is how do I filter through all the user meta info so that I can only return users with results that match both. Thanks for looking! -------- UPDATE -------------- This is the final code that worked for me:               SELECT u.ID, u.display_name     FROM wp_users AS u      LEFT JOIN wp_usermeta AS um1 ON u.ID = um1.user_id      LEFT JOIN wp_usermeta AS um2 ON u.ID = um2.user_id      WHERE  um1.meta_key = 'key1' AND um1.meta_value = 'value1'      AND um2.meta_key = 'keyA' AND um2.meta_value = 'valueA'     LIMIT 0, 60 |\n",

            "68 |9.49347987068273 |I have an issue that I believe can be solved one of two ways. I am using Featured Images in posts for content on a home page slider. What I would like to have happen is to have the destination links on click to be custom. Not the post or image URL of the post/featured image being used to feed the slider. 1) I thought I might be able to use the Image URL feature on the image itself, but it turns out the Featured Images will not accept a custom URL. It defaults back to the image path. 2) I have tried using a custom Post Meta field, but my attempts to retrieve that meta have been unsuccessful. I have set a Meta Field with the name 'slider-url' and have dropped the path to the desired destination page into the field. I am then using the following code in the loop for the slider (from the WP Codex) in an attempt to pull that value into the href='' `<?php echo get_post_meta($post->ID, 'slider-url', true); ?>` I am hoping someone might either have a hack for the Featured Image 'Image URL' (along with a way to retrieve that URL), or alternately some insight into why my custom post meta might not be working.

For example, select all usernames and ID for users with both where a meta_key= 'key1' and meta_value='value1' and also for the same user where another meta_key = 'keyA' and meta_value = 'valueA' In otherwords, I have multiple sets of metadata for a user, I'm looking for a specific set of users that meet criteria in two groups of metadata. There is no relation between the two metadata entries, except that they are both applied to the same user. The challenge that I am having is that I guess I'm trying to left join any metadata entry to the respective user without having to do a double query. Is it possible? Here's what I've tried:               SELECT wp_users.ID, wp_users.display_name     FROM wp_users LEFT JOIN wp_usermeta ON wp_users.ID = wp_usermeta.user_id AND       wp_usermeta.meta_value= 'value1'     WHERE  wp_usermeta.meta_key = 'keyA' AND wp_usermeta.meta_value = 'valueA'       I've also tried this:               SELECT wp_users.ID, wp_users.display_name     FROM wp_users LEFT JOIN wp_usermeta ON wp_users.ID = wp_usermeta.user_id        WHERE (wp_usermeta.meta_key = 'key1' AND wp_usermeta.meta_value= 'value1')     AND ( wp_usermeta.meta_key = 'keyA' AND wp_usermeta.meta_value = 'valueA')       Both these return empty sets. I suspect that it is only left joining to one usermeta entry and so when I'm telling it to look for the second set of values in the usermeta entry that has been left joined to the user entry that it returns an empty set. My question is how do I filter through all the user meta info so that I can only return users with results that match both.

What I would like to have happen is to have the destination links on click to be custom. Not the post or image URL of the post/featured image being used to feed the slider. 1) I thought I might be able to use the Image URL feature on the image itself, but it turns out the Featured Images will not accept a custom URL. It defaults back to the image path. 2) I have tried using a custom Post Meta field, but my attempts to retrieve that meta have been unsuccessful. I have set a Meta Field with the name \"slider-url\" and have dropped the path to the desired destination page into the field. I am then using the following code in the loop for the slider (from the WP Codex) in an attempt to pull that value into the href=\"\" `<?php echo get_post_meta($post->ID, \"slider-url\", true); ?>` I am hoping someone might either have a hack for the Featured Image \"Image URL\" (along with a way to retrieve that URL), or alternately some insight into why my custom post meta might not be working.

I'm using Amazon Product Advertising API for retrieving book data and covers. When adding a new 'book' into WordPress, the user copies the book ID (ASIN) into the post edit field, and clicks 'Publish'. Then, when saving the post, the post title (book title) and the author taxonomy term should be programmatically filled in through Amazon.

            "67 | 7.184011317305633 | **Scenario:** there is a 'Recommended Books' section on the website which uses the _'book' custom post type_ and the _'author' custom taxonomy_. I'm using Amazon Product Advertising API for retrieving book data and covers. When adding a new 'book' into WordPress, the user copies the book ID (ASIN) into the post edit field, and clicks 'Publish'. Then, when saving the post, the post title (book title) and the author taxonomy term should be programmatically filled in through Amazon. (These are used to offer 'Order by' functionality on the front end.) Currently I'm using `wp_insert_post_data` to hook into the 'book' saving process, and the `wp_set_object_terms` function to try to add the custom taxonomy term to the 'book'. **The problem is:** the `wp_set_object_terms` function doesn't seem to work. It won't add anything, albeit returns an array which, according to Codex, should mean success. Though the returning array is odd (as far as I see). When using post ID 107 and term ID 3 (instead of an author string, for testing purposes) the returning array displays the following with `print_r`:               Array     (     [0] => 3     )      (Also tried with `wp_set_post_terms`, and it makes no difference.) My complete function:               // Function to automatically retrieve and store Amazon Book data (title and author) when adding 'book' type posts     if( function_exists('asa_item') ) {         add_filter( 'wp_insert_post_data', 'filter_handler', '99', 2 );         function filter_handler( $data , $postarr ) {                  // Proceed only if book is added/edited             if ( $postarr['post_type'] !== 'book')                 return $data;                  // Try to Extract ASIN from post body; ignore everything else             if ( preg_match( '/([0-9A-Z]{10})/', $data['post_content'],  $matches) ) {                 // Successful, store ASIN                 $book_asin = $matches[0];                 // Wrap ASIN in AmazonSimpleAdmin shortcode (with 'cover' template) automatically for user convenience                 $data['post_content'] = '[asa cover]' . $matches[0] .

            "58 |7.4907225350775075 |I'm looking for a method to order posts by a custom field so that the navigational links on a single post template would point to the next or previous post in the sequence defined by a number in a custom field. Note: The posts are all in the same category. I can define the list of posts in the category in the order defined by the custom field value but when I view the single post, with a template modified to show only the selected category, the nav links at the bottom of the page are based on chronological sequence. What I need is a way to link to the next/previous post in the same category, where the order is defined by the custom field value. Is there anyway to override the chronological ordering of the posts? Thanks. |\n",

            "14 |6.582980559714496 |About a month ago I started a WordPress blog on a hosted server related to a hobby. So, I am new to this at present. Since I'm concerned about security, one thing I did was to install the plugin WP Security Scan. According to the plugin results, my site checks out except that I get this in the results as a red flag: > The file .htaccess does not exist in wp-admin/ (I ssh'd in there and it does > not exist) Ok, so I did a considerable search on the issue and find too much info on .htaccess. I've been through Hardening WordPress on the WordPress.org site, etc. And also ran into this article: http://digwp.com/2010/07/wordpress- security-lockdown/ Anyway, I've basically gotten confused with the plethora of information available. **What should the .htaccess file in wp-admin contain?** I've read that this .htaccess file should password protect the wp-admin directory and I've also read that this can cause functionality problems. Help with this is greatly appreciated. Thanks. -wdypdx22 **Update** Ok, so I'm not logged in to my blog and using a different computer than usual. I enter the url www.mysite.com/wordpress/wp-admin/ and there is a redirect to login. If that's what happens, then is an htaccess file even needed in the wp-admin directory? |\n",

            "66 |I have an issue that I believe can be solved one of two ways. I am using Featured Images in posts for content on a home page slider. What I would like to have happen is to have the destination links on click to be custom. Not the post or image URL of the post/featured image being used to feed the slider. 1) I thought I might be able to use the Image URL feature on the image itself, but it turns out the Featured Images will not accept a custom URL. It defaults back to the image path. 2) I have tried using a custom Post Meta field, but my attempts to retrieve that meta have been unsuccessful. I have set a Meta Field with the name 'slider-url' and have dropped the path to the desired destination page into the field. I am then using the following code in the loop for the slider (from the WP Codex) in an attempt to pull that value into the href='' `<?php echo get_post_meta($post->ID, 'slider-url', true); ?>` I am hoping someone might either have a hack for the Featured Image 'Image URL' (along with a way to retrieve that URL), or alternately some insight into why my custom post meta might not be working. Thanks in advance for your time and expertise. Cheers! EDIT: Here's the specific block of code. It's contained within the PHP file of the slider plugin.                   <div id='slider'>     <?php          $category = get_option('wpns_category');         $n_slices = get_option('wpns_slices');     ?>     <?php query_posts( 'cat='.$category.'&posts_per_page=$n_slices' ); if( have_posts() ) : while( have_posts() ) : the_post(); ?>         <?php if(has_post_thumbnail()) : ?>         <a href='<?php echo get_post_meta($post->ID, 'slider-url', true); ?>' title='<?php the_title(); ?>'>              <?php the_post_thumbnail(); ?>         </a>         <?php endif ?>         <?php endwhile; endif;?>         <?php wp_reset_query();?>     </div>      Additionally, here's a screen capture of the post meta field: http://s.sct.io/Bl6O Thanks again! |\n",

What I would like to have happen is to have the destination links on click to be custom.

For example; the url would be http://example.com/store/category/a-category/ and the breadcrumbs would only show 'home >> Store', with home being the only link...

Nothing is selected. The post are not displayed in the selected page as well. What might be problem? What can i do? Any idea of what happening would be helpful. **Edit** after posting When i see the value in options table through wp-admin/options.php for this `page_for_posts` option the page ID is selected. That is option has the slected page ID. but it is not showing post at the front page as well in the select box.\n",

            "66 | 4.416717531690941 | I have an issue that I believe can be solved one of two ways. I am using Featured Images in posts for content on a home page slider. What I would like to have happen is to have the destination links on click to be custom. Not the post or image URL of the post/featured image being used to feed the slider. 1) I thought I might be able to use the Image URL feature on the image itself, but it turns out the Featured Images will not accept a custom URL. It defaults back to the image path. 2) I have tried using a custom Post Meta field, but my attempts to retrieve that meta have been unsuccessful. I have set a Meta Field with the name \"slider-url\" and have dropped the path to the desired destination page into the field. I am then using the following code in the loop for the slider (from the WP Codex) in an attempt to pull that value into the href=\"\" `<?php echo get_post_meta($post->ID, \"slider-url\", true); ?>` I am hoping someone might either have a hack for the Featured Image \"Image URL\" (along with a way to retrieve that URL), or alternately some insight into why my custom post meta might not be working. Thanks in advance for your time and expertise. Cheers! EDIT: Here's the specific block of code. It's contained within the PHP file of the slider plugin.                   <div id=\"slider\">     <?php          $category = get_option('wpns_category');         $n_slices = get_option('wpns_slices');     ?>     <?php query_posts( 'cat='.$category.'&posts_per_page=$n_slices' ); if( have_posts() ) : while( have_posts() ) : the_post(); ?>         <?php if(has_post_thumbnail()) : ?>         <a href=\"<?php echo get_post_meta($post->ID, \"slider-url\", true); ?>\" title=\"<?php the_title(); ?>\">              <?php the_post_thumbnail(); ?>         </a>         <?php endif ?>         <?php endwhile; endif;?>         <?php wp_reset_query();?>     </div>      Additionally, here's a screen capture of the post meta field: http://s.sct.io/Bl6O Thanks again!\n",

This form takes like about 2-3s to render - it's a lot of of values in it - both hidden and not hidden.

When adding a new 'book' into WordPress, the user copies the book ID (ASIN) into the post edit field, and clicks 'Publish'.

            "67 |**Scenario:** there is a 'Recommended Books' section on the website which uses the _'book' custom post type_ and the _'author' custom taxonomy_. I'm using Amazon Product Advertising API for retrieving book data and covers. When adding a new 'book' into WordPress, the user copies the book ID (ASIN) into the post edit field, and clicks 'Publish'. Then, when saving the post, the post title (book title) and the author taxonomy term should be programmatically filled in through Amazon. (These are used to offer 'Order by' functionality on the front end.) Currently I'm using `wp_insert_post_data` to hook into the 'book' saving process, and the `wp_set_object_terms` function to try to add the custom taxonomy term to the 'book'. **The problem is:** the `wp_set_object_terms` function doesn't seem to work. It won't add anything, albeit returns an array which, according to Codex, should mean success. Though the returning array is odd (as far as I see). When using post ID 107 and term ID 3 (instead of an author string, for testing purposes) the returning array displays the following with `print_r`:               Array     (     [0] => 3     )      (Also tried with `wp_set_post_terms`, and it makes no difference.)

            "67 | 4.881866328658305 | **Scenario:** there is a 'Recommended Books' section on the website which uses the _'book' custom post type_ and the _'author' custom taxonomy_. I'm using Amazon Product Advertising API for retrieving book data and covers. When adding a new 'book' into WordPress, the user copies the book ID (ASIN) into the post edit field, and clicks 'Publish'. Then, when saving the post, the post title (book title) and the author taxonomy term should be programmatically filled in through Amazon. (These are used to offer 'Order by' functionality on the front end.) Currently I'm using `wp_insert_post_data` to hook into the 'book' saving process, and the `wp_set_object_terms` function to try to add the custom taxonomy term to the 'book'. **The problem is:** the `wp_set_object_terms` function doesn't seem to work. It won't add anything, albeit returns an array which, according to Codex, should mean success. Though the returning array is odd (as far as I see).

Ended up using this modified from the sample get_the_terms code in the WP Codex.               add_filter( 'the_author', 'feed_author' );     function feed_author($article_authors) {         if( is_feed() ) {            $author = get_the_terms( get_the_ID(), 'article_author' );            if ( $author && ! is_wp_error( $author ) ) {                  $byline = array();                foreach ( $author as $author ) {                $byline[] = $author->name;                }                   $article_authors = join( \" & \", $byline );               }                return $article_authors;         }     }\n",

Since I'm concerned about security, one thing I did was to install the plugin WP Security Scan. According to the plugin results, my site checks out except that I get this in the results as a red flag: > The file .htaccess does not exist in wp-admin/ (I ssh'd in there and it does > not exist) Ok, so I did a considerable search on the issue and find too much info on .htaccess. I've been through Hardening WordPress on the WordPress.org site, etc. And also ran into this article: http://digwp.com/2010/07/wordpress- security-lockdown/ Anyway, I've basically gotten confused with the plethora of information available. **What should the .htaccess file in wp-admin contain?** I've read that this .htaccess file should password protect the wp-admin directory and I've also read that this can cause functionality problems. Help with this is greatly appreciated. Thanks. -wdypdx22 **Update** Ok, so I'm not logged in to my blog and using a different computer than usual. I enter the url www.mysite.com/wordpress/wp-admin/ and there is a redirect to login. If that's what happens, then is an htaccess file even needed in the wp-admin directory? |\n",

            "58 | 9.638786857080486 | I'm doing some customization on a theme that was previously written by someone else. Rather than use multiple user accounts to assign articles, they created a taxonomy for the custom author name(s) so that an archive of posts by an author can be generated. The code is below, and it's working well. However, I'd also like to replace the author name in the feed. I assume it's going to be an extra filter and/or function. Can someone help me out?               add_filter( 'the_author_posts_link', 'custom_author_name' );     add_filter( 'get_the_author_display_name', 'custom_author_name' );     function custom_author_name( $name ) {         global $post;         $author = get_the_terms(get_the_ID(),'article_author');         if ( $author )             $name = the_terms(get_the_ID(),'article_author','',' & ');         return $name;     }      Update. I tried adding this function, based on code found elsewhere on stack exchange, but it seems to be overwriting the author on the whole site, not just the feed:               add_filter( 'the_author', 'feed_author' );     function feed_author($name) {       if( is_feed() ) {         global $post;         $author = get_the_terms(get_the_ID(),'article_author');          if ( $author )              $name = the_terms(get_the_ID(),'article_author','',' & ');          return $name;         }     }      Figured it out! Ended up using this modified from the sample get_the_terms code in the WP Codex.               add_filter( 'the_author', 'feed_author' );     function feed_author($article_authors) {         if( is_feed() ) {            $author = get_the_terms( get_the_ID(), 'article_author' );            if ( $author && ! is_wp_error( $author ) ) {                  $byline = array();                foreach ( $author as $author ) {                $byline[] = $author->name;                }                   $article_authors = join( \" & \", $byline );               }                return $article_authors;         }     }\n",

One thing that I'd really like to change is the URL structure for my blog. For example, instead of `sitio.com/category/gatos`, I'd like to change the URL to `sitio.com/categoria/gatos`. I know you can set the category base and tag base in Settings/Permalinks, but I'd like to know how to do this in code. Also, I want to translate `search/` to `busqueda/` and `page/` to `pagina/`. I want to translate all of these to Spanish.   * category_base   * author_base   * pagination_base   * feed_base   * search_base   * comments_base I'd like to be able to make these this just within my own theme (that I've made from scratch), that way these changes could be more portable. I've read the WordPress Codex for `WP_Rewrite` and have experimented with `add_rewrite_rule`, but I'm still stuck. Does anyone know where else I could look? **Update:** With this function, your search form can still use `name=\"s\"`, but the user will be redirect to the appropriate location on submit.               function redirectSearch()     {         // Make sure you redirect to whatever your search_base is.         if(!empty($_GET['s'])){             wp_redirect(home_url('/busqueda/').urlencode(get_query_var('s')));         }     }     add_action('template_redirect', 'redirectSearch');\n",

What I would like to have happen is to have the destination links on click to be custom. Not the post or image URL of the post/featured image being used to feed the slider. 1) I thought I might be able to use the Image URL feature on the image itself, but it turns out the Featured Images will not accept a custom URL. It defaults back to the image path. 2) I have tried using a custom Post Meta field, but my attempts to retrieve that meta have been unsuccessful. I have set a Meta Field with the name 'slider-url' and have dropped the path to the desired destination page into the field. I am then using the following code in the loop for the slider (from the WP Codex) in an attempt to pull that value into the href='' `<?php echo get_post_meta($post->ID, 'slider-url', true); ?>` I am hoping someone might either have a hack for the Featured Image 'Image URL' (along with a way to retrieve that URL), or alternately some insight into why my custom post meta might not be working.

            "55 |I recently changed my permalink structure from `/YYYY/MM/%post_name%/` to `/%post_name%/`, and lost my tweet counts and likes (provided by Jetpack) in the process. To fix this, I want Jetpack to use the old-style permalinks for stories dated prior to the change. Unfortunately, it looks like I'll have to filter the content of `get_permalink` to do it. So I have my function to return the fixed permalinks:               function jetpack_sharing_permalink( $permalink, $post, $leavename ) {              $url_change_date = strtotime( '23 February 2013' ); // Date of the URL changeover         $post_date = get_the_time( 'U', $post->ID );              if ( $post_date < $url_change_date ) :             $url_date_prefix = '/' . date( 'Y', $post_date ) . '/' . date( 'm', $post_date );             $permalink = str_replace( get_site_url(), get_site_url() . $url_date_prefix, $permalink );         endif;              return $permalink;          }        1. How do I use it to filter the output of `get_permalink`? Is my theme's `functions.php` too late?   2. How would I get started writing a 'baby' plugin (as suggested) so that `get_permalink` is only filtered for Jetpack's Sharing feature? Thanks in advance. |\n",

            "66 |I have an issue that I believe can be solved one of two ways. I am using Featured Images in posts for content on a home page slider. What I would like to have happen is to have the destination links on click to be custom. Not the post or image URL of the post/featured image being used to feed the slider. 1) I thought I might be able to use the Image URL feature on the image itself, but it turns out the Featured Images will not accept a custom URL. It defaults back to the image path. 2) I have tried using a custom Post Meta field, but my attempts to retrieve that meta have been unsuccessful. I have set a Meta Field with the name 'slider-url' and have dropped the path to the desired destination page into the field. I am then using the following code in the loop for the slider (from the WP Codex) in an attempt to pull that value into the href='' `<?php echo get_post_meta($post->ID, 'slider-url', true); ?>` I am hoping someone might either have a hack for the Featured Image 'Image URL' (along with a way to retrieve that URL), or alternately some insight into why my custom post meta might not be working.

What I would like to have happen is to have the destination links on click to be custom. Not the post or image URL of the post/featured image being used to feed the slider. 1) I thought I might be able to use the Image URL feature on the image itself, but it turns out the Featured Images will not accept a custom URL. It defaults back to the image path. 2) I have tried using a custom Post Meta field, but my attempts to retrieve that meta have been unsuccessful. I have set a Meta Field with the name 'slider-url' and have dropped the path to the desired destination page into the field. I am then using the following code in the loop for the slider (from the WP Codex) in an attempt to pull that value into the href='' `<?php echo get_post_meta($post->ID, 'slider-url', true); ?>` I am hoping someone might either have a hack for the Featured Image 'Image URL' (along with a way to retrieve that URL), or alternately some insight into why my custom post meta might not be working. Thanks in advance for your time and expertise. Cheers! EDIT: Here's the specific block of code.

What I would like to have happen is to have the destination links on click to be custom. Not the post or image URL of the post/featured image being used to feed the slider. 1) I thought I might be able to use the Image URL feature on the image itself, but it turns out the Featured Images will not accept a custom URL. It defaults back to the image path. 2) I have tried using a custom Post Meta field, but my attempts to retrieve that meta have been unsuccessful. I have set a Meta Field with the name \"slider-url\" and have dropped the path to the desired destination page into the field.

            "66 |I have an issue that I believe can be solved one of two ways. I am using Featured Images in posts for content on a home page slider. What I would like to have happen is to have the destination links on click to be custom. Not the post or image URL of the post/featured image being used to feed the slider. 1) I thought I might be able to use the Image URL feature on the image itself, but it turns out the Featured Images will not accept a custom URL. It defaults back to the image path. 2) I have tried using a custom Post Meta field, but my attempts to retrieve that meta have been unsuccessful. I have set a Meta Field with the name 'slider-url' and have dropped the path to the desired destination page into the field. I am then using the following code in the loop for the slider (from the WP Codex) in an attempt to pull that value into the href='' `<?php echo get_post_meta($post->ID, 'slider-url', true); ?>` I am hoping someone might either have a hack for the Featured Image 'Image URL' (along with a way to retrieve that URL), or alternately some insight into why my custom post meta might not be working. Thanks in advance for your time and expertise. Cheers! EDIT: Here's the specific block of code. It's contained within the PHP file of the slider plugin.                   <div id='slider'>     <?php          $category = get_option('wpns_category');         $n_slices = get_option('wpns_slices');     ?>     <?php query_posts( 'cat='.$category.'&posts_per_page=$n_slices' ); if( have_posts() ) : while( have_posts() ) : the_post(); ?>         <?php if(has_post_thumbnail()) : ?>         <a href='<?php echo get_post_meta($post->ID, 'slider-url', true); ?>' title='<?php the_title(); ?>'>              <?php the_post_thumbnail(); ?>         </a>         <?php endif ?>         <?php endwhile; endif;?>         <?php wp_reset_query();?>     </div>      Additionally, here's a screen capture of the post meta field: http://s.sct.io/Bl6O Thanks again! |\n",

I'm intentionally using direct queries to the database here. ) I'm trying to select a group of users that have two distinct meta key and meta value parameters. For example, select all usernames and ID for users with both where a meta_key= 'key1' and meta_value='value1' and also for the same user where another meta_key = 'keyA' and meta_value = 'valueA' In otherwords, I have multiple sets of metadata for a user, I'm looking for a specific set of users that meet criteria in two groups of metadata. There is no relation between the two metadata entries, except that they are both applied to the same user. The challenge that I am having is that I guess I'm trying to left join any metadata entry to the respective user without having to do a double query. Is it possible? Here's what I've tried:               SELECT wp_users.ID, wp_users.display_name     FROM wp_users LEFT JOIN wp_usermeta ON wp_users.ID = wp_usermeta.user_id AND       wp_usermeta.meta_value= 'value1'     WHERE  wp_usermeta.meta_key = 'keyA' AND wp_usermeta.meta_value = 'valueA'       I've also tried this:               SELECT wp_users.ID, wp_users.display_name     FROM wp_users LEFT JOIN wp_usermeta ON wp_users.ID = wp_usermeta.user_id        WHERE (wp_usermeta.meta_key = 'key1' AND wp_usermeta.meta_value= 'value1')     AND ( wp_usermeta.meta_key = 'keyA' AND wp_usermeta.meta_value = 'valueA')       Both these return empty sets. I suspect that it is only left joining to one usermeta entry and so when I'm telling it to look for the second set of values in the usermeta entry that has been left joined to the user entry that it returns an empty set. My question is how do I filter through all the user meta info so that I can only return users with results that match both.

            "35 |i've just begun participating these stack overflow forums yesterday and had a great experience with someone who could problem solve with me. working from the admin panel under the themes tab i have what looks like a working theme locations panel. i followed instructions i found for installing the proper php code in the proper functions.php file and then placed it where i wanted it to appear in the proper file for my theme. my issue is it won't actually function the way it was intended, i have 3 different menu's created but the site displays every page i created. i obviously slipped somewhere along the way but i can't find where. here's what i have in my functions.php:                       add_theme_support( 'menus' );          add_action( 'init', 'my_custom_menus' );     function my_custom_menus() {         register_nav_menus(             array(                 'primary-menu' => __( 'Primary Menu' ),                 'secondary-menu' => __( 'Secondary Menu' )             )         );     }                 here's whats in my sidebar.php:               <aside>         <div class='textBody'>         <div class='sideNav'>             <?php wp_nav_menu( array( 'theme_location' => 'extra-menu' ) ); ?>         </div>         </div>     </aside>      still learning, even posting on this site has a learning curve... thanks for reading this and any help or time is appreciated. |\n",

            "49 | 8.053969103622109 | Thank you for reading! There's a lot redirecting going on on the site I'm creating. For example,   * if not logged in user access a \"private\" page, he will be redirected to a custom login page.   * if the user logs in, he will be redirected to the last page he visited before accessing the login form. Let's call the pages \"Profile\" and \"LogIn\". So, if everything goes well should be: > -> not logged try to access **Profile** -> redirect to **LogIn** -> if OK > redirect to **Profile** However, when **LogIn** calls wp_get_referer(), it does NOT return **Profile**. Instead it goes \"2 pages\" back. Is like \"wp_get_referer()\" is not seing **Profile** as the referer because is acting as a redirection. Just like the \"Back\" button in the browser would. **If you go to the LogIn through any 'public' page (clicking the link) the redirect after login in works fine.** **page-profile.php**               if( !is_user_logged_in() ) {             wp_redirect( get_permalink(37) ); //id 37 = page-login.php         exit;     }      **page-login.php**               //Set referer     $referer = wp_get_referer();     if( !$referer || referer_is_login_page($referer) )         $referer = get_bloginfo('url');     simpleSessionSet('login_referer', $referer);          ...      //Log the user in      ...          if ( is_wp_error($user_id) )                     $errores = TRUE;     else          wp_redirect( simpleSessionGet('login_referer', '') );\n",

For example,   * if not logged in user access a 'private' page, he will be redirected to a custom login page.   * if the user logs in, he will be redirected to the last page he visited before accessing the login form. Let's call the pages 'Profile' and 'LogIn'. So, if everything goes well should be: > -> not logged try to access **Profile** -> redirect to **LogIn** -> if OK > redirect to **Profile** However, when **LogIn** calls wp_get_referer(), it does NOT return **Profile**. Instead it goes '2 pages' back. Is like 'wp_get_referer()' is not seing **Profile** as the referer because is acting as a redirection. Just like the 'Back' button in the browser would. **If you go to the LogIn through any 'public' page (clicking the link) the redirect after login in works fine.** **page-profile.php**               if( !is_user_logged_in() ) {             wp_redirect( get_permalink(37) ); //id 37 = page-login.php         exit;     }      **page-login.php**               //Set referer     $referer = wp_get_referer();     if( !$referer || referer_is_login_page($referer) )         $referer = get_bloginfo('url');     simpleSessionSet('login_referer', $referer);          ...      //Log the user in      ...          if ( is_wp_error($user_id) )                     $errores = TRUE;     else          wp_redirect( simpleSessionGet('login_referer', '') ); |\n",

            "55 | 10.304815299727347 | I recently changed my permalink structure from `/YYYY/MM/%post_name%/` to `/%post_name%/`, and lost my tweet counts and likes (provided by Jetpack) in the process. To fix this, I want Jetpack to use the old-style permalinks for stories dated prior to the change. Unfortunately, it looks like I'll have to filter the content of `get_permalink` to do it. So I have my function to return the fixed permalinks:               function jetpack_sharing_permalink( $permalink, $post, $leavename ) {              $url_change_date = strtotime( \"23 February 2013\" ); // Date of the URL changeover         $post_date = get_the_time( 'U', $post->ID );              if ( $post_date < $url_change_date ) :             $url_date_prefix = \"/\" . date( \"Y\", $post_date ) . \"/\" . date( \"m\", $post_date );             $permalink = str_replace( get_site_url(), get_site_url() . $url_date_prefix, $permalink );         endif;              return $permalink;          }        1. How do I use it to filter the output of `get_permalink`? Is my theme's `functions.php` too late?   2.

For example,   * if not logged in user access a 'private' page, he will be redirected to a custom login page.   * if the user logs in, he will be redirected to the last page he visited before accessing the login form. Let's call the pages 'Profile' and 'LogIn'. So, if everything goes well should be: > -> not logged try to access **Profile** -> redirect to **LogIn** -> if OK > redirect to **Profile** However, when **LogIn** calls wp_get_referer(), it does NOT return **Profile**. Instead it goes '2 pages' back. Is like 'wp_get_referer()' is not seing **Profile** as the referer because is acting as a redirection.

My question is: Is there any way just to save post data when upate - like hooking ajax-call to UPDATE-button (I really don't have to reload the page cause it doesn't change anything)? **UPDATE:** I guess I could something like this (in jQuery)               $( '#publish' ).click( function( e ) {         e.preventDefault();         //ajax call to save current postetc.         //done = alert('post saved');     } );      but would that be right? |\n",

What solutions have you tried and used for this?\n",

            "49 | 4.545256619390895 | Thank you for reading! There's a lot redirecting going on on the site I'm creating. For example,   * if not logged in user access a \"private\" page, he will be redirected to a custom login page.   * if the user logs in, he will be redirected to the last page he visited before accessing the login form. Let's call the pages \"Profile\" and \"LogIn\". So, if everything goes well should be: > -> not logged try to access **Profile** -> redirect to **LogIn** -> if OK > redirect to **Profile** However, when **LogIn** calls wp_get_referer(), it does NOT return **Profile**. Instead it goes \"2 pages\" back. Is like \"wp_get_referer()\" is not seing **Profile** as the referer because is acting as a redirection. Just like the \"Back\" button in the browser would. **If you go to the LogIn through any 'public' page (clicking the link) the redirect after login in works fine.** **page-profile.php**               if( !is_user_logged_in() ) {             wp_redirect( get_permalink(37) ); //id 37 = page-login.php         exit;     }      **page-login.php**               //Set referer     $referer = wp_get_referer();     if( !$referer || referer_is_login_page($referer) )         $referer = get_bloginfo('url');     simpleSessionSet('login_referer', $referer);          ...      //Log the user in      ...          if ( is_wp_error($user_id) )                     $errores = TRUE;     else          wp_redirect( simpleSessionGet('login_referer', '') );\n",

What we do is to enqueue our stylesheets and scripts using `functions.php`. And similarly WordPress plugins also enqueue their stylesheets and scripts using the same method. So, in the end there are many enqueued styles and scripts in header or footer. What Google PageSpeed recommends is: > **Optimize the order of styles and scripts** \\- Google PageSpeed We know, `wp_enqueue_script()` and `wp_enqueue_style()` offer a `$deps` parameter, where we can define the depth or priority of the script or stylesheet. But that affects only within scripts and styles, not in both. So, with a combined load of scripts and stylesheets from the theme, and/or child theme, and/or plugins, and/or third party API etc. how can we let the WordPress to enqueue them all in a way so that site speed improves with a sound website's quality?

When I update this custom post it takes about 2 seconds to update - and after the update it redirects to the custom post and renders the form again, so overall it could take about 8-9 seconds (regeneration of menu, some other stuff that is loaded each time in the wp-admin area). My question is: Is there any way just to save post data when upate - like hooking ajax-call to UPDATE-button (I really don't have to reload the page cause it doesn't change anything)? **UPDATE:** I guess I could something like this (in jQuery)               $( '#publish' ).click( function( e ) {         e.preventDefault();         //ajax call to save current postetc.         //done = alert('post saved');     } );      but would that be right?\n",

I currently have an 'add to basket' button within the flash application that doesn't do anything. I'd like it to add a product to the basket when clicked. Writing a flash function with event clicks is no problem, but I'm not sure how to connect to the shopping basket and would appreciate any advice on how to do this. It _appears_ to be done in AJAX but I'm not confident in this. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you Dean EDIT AFTER MILO'S COMMENTS: Thanks Milo. Once I understand how to invoke the existing \"function wpsc_add_to_cart()\" I'll try to make it more efficient and implement what you have suggested, but at the moment I'm struggling to invoke the existing one from within flash.

What we do is to enqueue our stylesheets and scripts using `functions.php`. And similarly WordPress plugins also enqueue their stylesheets and scripts using the same method. So, in the end there are many enqueued styles and scripts in header or footer. What Google PageSpeed recommends is: > **Optimize the order of styles and scripts** \\- Google PageSpeed We know, `wp_enqueue_script()` and `wp_enqueue_style()` offer a `$deps` parameter, where we can define the depth or priority of the script or stylesheet. But that affects only within scripts and styles, not in both. So, with a combined load of scripts and stylesheets from the theme, and/or child theme, and/or plugins, and/or third party API etc. how can we let the WordPress to enqueue them all in a way so that site speed improves with a sound website's quality?   Or, are they bulletproof to echo styles first, than scripts?\n",
            "27 | 4.225337006626552 | I have a site with a custom post. When I enter that custom post in admin (edit)-page then a form is rendered. This form takes like about 2-3s to render - it's a lot of of values in it - both hidden and not hidden. When I update this custom post it takes about 2 seconds to update - and after the update it redirects to the custom post and renders the form again, so overall it could take about 8-9 seconds (regeneration of menu, some other stuff that is loaded each time in the wp-admin area). My question is: Is there any way just to save post data when upate - like hooking ajax-call to UPDATE-button (I really don't have to reload the page cause it doesn't change anything)? **UPDATE:** I guess I could something like this (in jQuery)               $( '#publish' ).click( function( e ) {         e.preventDefault();         //ajax call to save current postetc.         //done = alert('post saved');     } );      but would that be right?\n",

What I would like to have happen is to have the destination links on click to be custom. Not the post or image URL of the post/featured image being used to feed the slider. 1) I thought I might be able to use the Image URL feature on the image itself, but it turns out the Featured Images will not accept a custom URL. It defaults back to the image path. 2) I have tried using a custom Post Meta field, but my attempts to retrieve that meta have been unsuccessful. I have set a Meta Field with the name 'slider-url' and have dropped the path to the desired destination page into the field. I am then using the following code in the loop for the slider (from the WP Codex) in an attempt to pull that value into the href='' `<?php echo get_post_meta($post->ID, 'slider-url', true); ?>` I am hoping someone might either have a hack for the Featured Image 'Image URL' (along with a way to retrieve that URL), or alternately some insight into why my custom post meta might not be working.

            "66 |I have an issue that I believe can be solved one of two ways. I am using Featured Images in posts for content on a home page slider. What I would like to have happen is to have the destination links on click to be custom. Not the post or image URL of the post/featured image being used to feed the slider. 1) I thought I might be able to use the Image URL feature on the image itself, but it turns out the Featured Images will not accept a custom URL. It defaults back to the image path. 2) I have tried using a custom Post Meta field, but my attempts to retrieve that meta have been unsuccessful.

            "94 |5.237851626151736 |Can I mess up my Wordpress site if I change `functions.php` file for my custom theme? One time I added some code to it and it gave me some PHP errors and my site was inaccessible. Luckily it was in the early stage of the website so I just reinstalled Wordpress. So, my actual question is - does `functions.php` file have any influence on any other file or database or any other part of the website? If I have a back up of the `functions.php` file, can I just replace the screwed up file via FTP or do I have to do something else? The same questions goes for `.htaccess` file - if I add this code:               php_flag register_globals off      to it, can I change something irreversibly or do I just upload the back up and all goes back to normal? |\n",

What I would like to have happen is to have the destination links on click to be custom. Not the post or image URL of the post/featured image being used to feed the slider. 1) I thought I might be able to use the Image URL feature on the image itself, but it turns out the Featured Images will not accept a custom URL. It defaults back to the image path. 2) I have tried using a custom Post Meta field, but my attempts to retrieve that meta have been unsuccessful. I have set a Meta Field with the name 'slider-url' and have dropped the path to the desired destination page into the field. I am then using the following code in the loop for the slider (from the WP Codex) in an attempt to pull that value into the href='' `<?php echo get_post_meta($post->ID, 'slider-url', true); ?>` I am hoping someone might either have a hack for the Featured Image 'Image URL' (along with a way to retrieve that URL), or alternately some insight into why my custom post meta might not be working.

            "15 |( I would ask this in the general stack exchange forum but I think it is more relevant here. I'm intentionally using direct queries to the database here. ) I'm trying to select a group of users that have two distinct meta key and meta value parameters. For example, select all usernames and ID for users with both where a meta_key= 'key1' and meta_value='value1' and also for the same user where another meta_key = 'keyA' and meta_value = 'valueA' In otherwords, I have multiple sets of metadata for a user, I'm looking for a specific set of users that meet criteria in two groups of metadata. There is no relation between the two metadata entries, except that they are both applied to the same user. The challenge that I am having is that I guess I'm trying to left join any metadata entry to the respective user without having to do a double query. Is it possible? Here's what I've tried:               SELECT wp_users.ID, wp_users.display_name     FROM wp_users LEFT JOIN wp_usermeta ON wp_users.ID = wp_usermeta.user_id AND       wp_usermeta.meta_value= 'value1'     WHERE  wp_usermeta.meta_key = 'keyA' AND wp_usermeta.meta_value = 'valueA'       I've also tried this:               SELECT wp_users.ID, wp_users.display_name     FROM wp_users LEFT JOIN wp_usermeta ON wp_users.ID = wp_usermeta.user_id        WHERE (wp_usermeta.meta_key = 'key1' AND wp_usermeta.meta_value= 'value1')     AND ( wp_usermeta.meta_key = 'keyA' AND wp_usermeta.meta_value = 'valueA')       Both these return empty sets. I suspect that it is only left joining to one usermeta entry and so when I'm telling it to look for the second set of values in the usermeta entry that has been left joined to the user entry that it returns an empty set. My question is how do I filter through all the user meta info so that I can only return users with results that match both. Thanks for looking! -------- UPDATE -------------- This is the final code that worked for me:               SELECT u.ID, u.display_name     FROM wp_users AS u      LEFT JOIN wp_usermeta AS um1 ON u.ID = um1.user_id      LEFT JOIN wp_usermeta AS um2 ON u.ID = um2.user_id      WHERE  um1.meta_key = 'key1' AND um1.meta_value = 'value1'      AND um2.meta_key = 'keyA' AND um2.meta_value = 'valueA'     LIMIT 0, 60 |\n",

            "14 | 4.880733632146279 | About a month ago I started a WordPress blog on a hosted server related to a hobby. So, I am new to this at present. Since I'm concerned about security, one thing I did was to install the plugin WP Security Scan. According to the plugin results, my site checks out except that I get this in the results as a red flag: > The file .htaccess does not exist in wp-admin/ (I ssh'd in there and it does > not exist) Ok, so I did a considerable search on the issue and find too much info on .htaccess. I've been through Hardening WordPress on the WordPress.org site, etc. And also ran into this article: http://digwp.com/2010/07/wordpress- security-lockdown/ Anyway, I've basically gotten confused with the plethora of information available. **What should the .htaccess file in wp-admin contain?** I've read that this .htaccess file should password protect the wp-admin directory and I've also read that this can cause functionality problems. Help with this is greatly appreciated. Thanks. -wdypdx22 **Update** Ok, so I'm not logged in to my blog and using a different computer than usual. I enter the url www.mysite.com/wordpress/wp-admin/ and there is a redirect to login. If that's what happens, then is an htaccess file even needed in the wp-admin directory?\n",

What I haven't been able to figure out is how to reference custom taxonomies. Within a custom post type, I have a category that I want to reference (i.e. `customcategory`). If I try adding `%%customcategory%%`, it doesn't work. Does anyone know if this is possible with the WordPress SEO plugin or point me in the right direction if I need to add a function to work with the plugin?\n",

            "15 | 16.995928459355778 | ( I would ask this in the general stack exchange forum but I think it is more relevant here. I'm intentionally using direct queries to the database here. ) I'm trying to select a group of users that have two distinct meta key and meta value parameters. For example, select all usernames and ID for users with both where a meta_key= \"key1\" and meta_value=\"value1\" and also for the same user where another meta_key = \"keyA\" and meta_value = \"valueA\" In otherwords, I have multiple sets of metadata for a user, I'm looking for a specific set of users that meet criteria in two groups of metadata. There is no relation between the two metadata entries, except that they are both applied to the same user. The challenge that I am having is that I guess I'm trying to left join any metadata entry to the respective user without having to do a double query. Is it possible? Here's what I've tried:               SELECT wp_users.ID, wp_users.display_name     FROM wp_users LEFT JOIN wp_usermeta ON wp_users.ID = wp_usermeta.user_id AND       wp_usermeta.meta_value= 'value1'     WHERE  wp_usermeta.meta_key = 'keyA' AND wp_usermeta.meta_value = 'valueA'       I've also tried this:               SELECT wp_users.ID, wp_users.display_name     FROM wp_users LEFT JOIN wp_usermeta ON wp_users.ID = wp_usermeta.user_id        WHERE (wp_usermeta.meta_key = 'key1' AND wp_usermeta.meta_value= 'value1')     AND ( wp_usermeta.meta_key = 'keyA' AND wp_usermeta.meta_value = 'valueA')       Both these return empty sets. I suspect that it is only left joining to one usermeta entry and so when I'm telling it to look for the second set of values in the usermeta entry that has been left joined to the user entry that it returns an empty set. My question is how do I filter through all the user meta info so that I can only return users with results that match both. Thanks for looking! -------- UPDATE -------------- This is the final code that worked for me:               SELECT u.ID, u.display_name     FROM wp_users AS u      LEFT JOIN wp_usermeta AS um1 ON u.ID = um1.user_id      LEFT JOIN wp_usermeta AS um2 ON u.ID = um2.user_id      WHERE  um1.meta_key = 'key1' AND um1.meta_value = 'value1'      AND um2.meta_key = 'keyA' AND um2.meta_value = 'valueA'     LIMIT 0, 60\n",
