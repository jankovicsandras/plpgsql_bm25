While these pages do share some common, static content (headers, etc) most of the information on the page is populated specifically for that user using a variety of usermeta, postmeta and custom table data. Further, a user is unlikely to hit the same page a lot of times. However, there are tens of thousands of users who may wish to be accessing their own information pages simultaneously, so performance is of great concern. My understanding of cacheing plugins is that they do a great job with relatively static content, such as blog entries or 'about us' pages, that change infrequently but must be served up (without any differences or customized info) to a lot of simultaneous requests. In my situation, the real performance 'hit' comes once a user has logged in and is accessing their personal information. How effective are cacheing plugins in this scenario?

A vendor post has various meta fields associated with it including some for their address. What I want to do is to bring up a product and then a) get the connected vendor and THEN b) query for meta values for that vendor. The reason I want this is that I need to be able to show a visitor all of the products made in a particular state and the state information resides in the vendor CPT, not the product CPT.
