        "\n",
        "```plpgsql\n",
        "  SELECT bm25createindex( tablename, columnname );  /* tablename and columnname are TEXT types */\n",

        "### What is this?\n",
        " - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25\n",
        " - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/pgSQL\n",
        " - https://github.com/dorianbrown/rank_bm25\n",
        " - TLDR:\n",
        "    - BM25Okapi is a popular search algorithm.\n",
        "    - Index building: Initially, there's a list of texts or documents called the corpus. Each document will be split to words (or tokens) with the tokenization function (the simplest is split on whitespace characters). The algorithm then builds a word-score-map ```wsmap```, where every word in the corpus is scored for every document based on their frequencies, ca. how special a word is in the corpus and how frequent in the current document.\n",
        "    - Search: the question text (or query string) will be tokenized, then the search function looks up the words from ```wsmap``` and sums the scores for each document; the result is a list of scores, one for each document. The highest scoring document is the best match. The search function sorts the scores-documentIDs in descending order.\n",
        "    - Adding a new document to the corpus or changing one requires rebuilding the whole BM25 index (```wsmap```), because of how the algorithm works.\n",
        "\n",
        "----\n",
        "### Repo contents\n",
        " - ```plpgsql_bm25.sql``` : PL/pgSQL functions for BM25 search\n",
        " - ```plpgsql_bm25_test.ipynb``` : Latest Jupyter notebook with comparative testing of plpgsql_bm25.sql, rank_bm25 and mybm25okapi.py.\n",

        "\n",
        "----\n",
        "### Why?\n",
        "Postgres has already Full Text Search and there are several extensions that implement BM25. But Full Text Search is not the same as BM25. The BM25 extensions are written in Rust, which might not be available / practical, especially in hosted environments. See Alternatives section for more info.\n",

        "\n",
        "   - NOTE: this is useful for fuzzy string matching, like spelling correction, but not query->document search solution itself.\n",
        "The differing document and query text lengths will result very small relative trigram frequencies and incorrect/missing matching.\n",

When I'm editing a post with an embedded image, or when I'm viewing images through the media library, they are loaded using the http:// protocol rather than https.

The frontend loads over regular http, so I don't want to do any replacing in the DB that will force images to load over https outside of the admin.

I'm a bit stuck however.               function make_posts_from_taxonomy($taxonomy, $post_type) {     // Get all Taxonomy     $args = array(     'parent' => 0     );          $taxonomy = 'hhie_artists';     $post_type = 'hhie_artists';          $terms = get_terms( $taxonomy, $args);          foreach ($terms as $term) {         get_term_by( 'slug', get_query_var( 'term' ), get_query_var( 'taxonomy' ) );         $id = $term->ID;         $name = $term->name; //Title         $slug = $term->slug; //Slug         $description = $term->description; //Description          $new_post = array(               'post_title' => $name,             'post_content' => $description,             'post_name' => $slug,             'post_type' => $post_type,         );         //Insert post         wp_insert_post ($new_post);              } //End foreach          } //End function      This has worked. I've been able to create the new CPT posts. Remaining issues:   1. I can't work out how to call all the metadata associated with each `$term`.   2. How can I then pass each piece of metadata into each post?\n",

I've decided I'm best off creating a Custom Post Type to handle my database of Artists and Albums on my music site, currently stored as a Custom Taxonomy. There's clearly more flexibility in CPTs than Taxonomies. I'm going to use Scribu's Posts2Posts plugin to connect my current CPTs (Videos, Lyrics, Reviews etc) with the Artists and Albums CPTs. Since I have a large-ish quantity in my Artists Taxonomy including lots of meta data, I'm looking for a way to carry the data to a CPT (and corresponding Meta Fields) - too much to do by hand.

            "13 |5.834350677108863 |I've created a menu using wp_nav_menu in my theme using the most simple setup as possible:               wp_nav_menu( array( 'theme_location' => 'my_theme_top_menu') );      And in my functions.php:               register_nav_menus(         array('my_theme_top_menu' => 'Top Menu' )     );      However, I'm running into strange behaviour when the user creates a menu in wp-admin and assigns it to this menu. When you first select the theme, it defaults to the default menu built from pages, the markup looks like this:               <div class='menu'>         <ul>            <li class='page_item page-item-51'>                <a href='http://www.mdunham.co.uk/bligs/'>About Us</a>      But, if a user selects one of their pre-defined menus the markup that builds the menu completely changes:                <div class='menu-main-menu-container'>         <ul id='menu-main-menu' class='menu'>                <li id='menu-item-102' class='menu-item menu-item-type-post_type menu-item-object-page current-menu-item page_item page-item-29 current_page_item menu-item-102'>                    <a href='http://www.site.co.uk/'>Home</a></li>      Why is this happening? It's like when uses a defined menu WP menu it WP defaults(or settings I've defined), yet when there is no defined menu and it falls back it uses a different, bastardized set of options which I haven't actually set anywhere myself. |\n",
            "12 |4.830606568564645 |This must be pretty simple, but when I use the function below in header.php to grab the post excerpt to use a meta description for a single post or page `setup_postdata($post); $excerpt = get_the_excerpt(); echo $excerpt;` I end up with html entities for apostrophes, quotes, etc., like this:               <meta name='description' content='There&amp;#8217;s an interesting thing     going on in the world of digital music; it&amp;#8217;s moving     into the &amp;#8220;cloud.&amp;#8221; ...'>      I've tried `echo htmlentities($excerpt);` and `echo html_entity_decode($excerpt);` with no luck. How can I prevent those entities from showing up? I'm not using a function in functions.php to generate an excerpt. This is kind of a workaround, as I have hundreds of posts that don't have a manual excerpt, and I think manual excerpts are immune to the entity issue, and that's why I am trying to use the standard excerpt. |\n",
            "3 |4.199221008875678 |I've not been able to find any information on this - a bit of an unusual request. I've decided I'm best off creating a Custom Post Type to handle my database of Artists and Albums on my music site, currently stored as a Custom Taxonomy. There's clearly more flexibility in CPTs than Taxonomies. I'm going to use Scribu's Posts2Posts plugin to connect my current CPTs (Videos, Lyrics, Reviews etc) with the Artists and Albums CPTs. Since I have a large-ish quantity in my Artists Taxonomy including lots of meta data, I'm looking for a way to carry the data to a CPT (and corresponding Meta Fields) - too much to do by hand. Has anyone else got this issue, and has anyone got a solution? **UPDATE** : I'm writing a function that I hope will achieve what I need. I'm a bit stuck however.               function make_posts_from_taxonomy($taxonomy, $post_type) {     // Get all Taxonomy     $args = array(     'parent' => 0     );          $taxonomy = 'hhie_artists';     $post_type = 'hhie_artists';          $terms = get_terms( $taxonomy, $args);          foreach ($terms as $term) {         get_term_by( 'slug', get_query_var( 'term' ), get_query_var( 'taxonomy' ) );         $id = $term->ID;         $name = $term->name; //Title         $slug = $term->slug; //Slug         $description = $term->description; //Description          $new_post = array(               'post_title' => $name,             'post_content' => $description,             'post_name' => $slug,             'post_type' => $post_type,         );         //Insert post         wp_insert_post ($new_post);              } //End foreach          } //End function      This has worked. I've been able to create the new CPT posts. Remaining issues:   1. I can't work out how to call all the metadata associated with each `$term`.   2. How can I then pass each piece of metadata into each post? |\n",

I'm a bit stuck however.               function make_posts_from_taxonomy($taxonomy, $post_type) {     // Get all Taxonomy     $args = array(     'parent' => 0     );          $taxonomy = 'hhie_artists';     $post_type = 'hhie_artists';          $terms = get_terms( $taxonomy, $args);          foreach ($terms as $term) {         get_term_by( 'slug', get_query_var( 'term' ), get_query_var( 'taxonomy' ) );         $id = $term->ID;         $name = $term->name; //Title         $slug = $term->slug; //Slug         $description = $term->description; //Description          $new_post = array(               'post_title' => $name,             'post_content' => $description,             'post_name' => $slug,             'post_type' => $post_type,         );         //Insert post         wp_insert_post ($new_post);              } //End foreach          } //End function      This has worked. I've been able to create the new CPT posts. Remaining issues:   1. I can't work out how to call all the metadata associated with each `$term`.   2. How can I then pass each piece of metadata into each post?\n",

            "1 |1.3218397996591134 |I have a working script that hooks to user profile. This is my hook:               add_action('personal_options', array(&$this,'show_bounce_email_warning_to_user'),10,1);       As you can see it will show bounce email warnings at the profile page. This works well when the user access his user profile by this URL for example:               http://my-multisite.com/wp-admin/profile.php      However most users do not login using the root admin page. But to their specific websites (which is a subdomain of the multisite) for example:               http://userwebsite.my-multisite.com/wp-admin/      But the email warning at the personal options page (at user profile) does not appear in any of the user websites under the multisite:               http://userwebsite.my-multisite.com/wp-admin/profile.php      I need the warnings to appear in all user profiles that the user is logged-in. Not just when accessing the root WP admin URL. What is the hook to use? Any tips is highly appreciated thanks!
